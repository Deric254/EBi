The Technician Brought A Cheap Hanging Hook That Had Mrp Inr116 On It And Asked For Inr499 For It Without Any Receipt. He Kept Telling That It Was Not For Sale And Company Had Sent This Specially. However, It Clearly Had Mrp Mentioned On It2. I Went To Market And Bought A Much Better Cabinet For Just Inr200 And For Installation Of That As Well, Technician Was Really Adamant To Drill The Two Required Holes On Top. He Just Drilled One On Top And One On Bottom And Kept All The Other Spare Screws ( Which I Had Bought ) With Him. After About Half An Hour Of Arguments, He Finally Drilled The Other Required Holes. And For All This, He Kept Cussing Me That I Wasted His Time. There Was No Assistance From The Person Who Represented The Service Agency As Well.This Whole Process Took Me Two Hours To Complete That Too With Lots Of Arguments. This Was The Worst Installation Experience In My Life So Far.Bottomline - Please Do Not Avail The 'So Called Free' Installation Service From Amazon. It Is Just A Scam. Instead Call The Acer Support. They Will Do The Job Much Better.,After Using It For 2 Months, Here Are It'S Pros And Cons:Pros :1. Great Picture Quality. It'S Awesome.2. Blacks Are Very Good And Is Adjustable.3. Sound With 30Db Is Very Good4. Looks Great With Thin Besel5. Remote Comes With Favorite Ott Buttons.6. Content Upscaling Is Very Good.Cons:1. Remote Could Have Been Better. Can'T Use Dth Remote To Turn On Both Televisison And Set Top Box.2. Remote Operation Is Bit Complex.3. Motion Technology Not Great. There Is A Noticeable Blur When Watching Moving Ballson Ott, But It Decreases When You Switch To Dth.Overall, It'S A Nice Buy At This Price Point. I Think I Am Getting Fairly Better Picture Quality And Sound. I Am Satisfied With The Product.,Product Has Good Picture Quality. Good Product At That Price With 25W Sound. Applications Running Smoothly. 3 Months Older & No Issues Yet. It'S Running Smoothly.,You Get Decent Features For The Price You Pay. Screen Resolution Might Be. Set Back As You May Find Pixalation. Overall It'S Good,I Am Amazed With The Picture Quality Of This 720P (Hd Ready) Tv. It Is Truly An Amazing Panel. I Found It Suitable For A Viewing Distance Of Between 6 To 10 Feet. Any Nearer It May Not Look Very Crisp And Any Farther, It Will Feel Like A Very Small Size. The Speakers Are Also Very Good For The Price And Can Get Very Loud Without Any Distortions. However, Since The Speaker Is Downward Firing, The Experience Will Vary Based On Whether The Tv Is Wall Mounted Or Kept On A Stand.The Remote Is Good, Voice Search Works Well For Me. Tv Start Up Takes A Long Time In My Opinion, But I Have Not Compared It Against Any Other 32 Inch Tv And Hence Do Not Know Where It Stands Among Peers.5 Ghz Wifi Works Very Well Even Across Walls. Only Negative Aspect I Faced Is W.R.T The Experience Of Using My Bluetooth Headphones/Earphones. Firstly, The Connection Sometimes Doesn'T Happen Automatically After A  Restart - Which Means I Have To Remove And Re-Discover The Device Thru The Menu Which Is Not Simple. Secondly, The Signal Itself Seems To Be Very Weak And Even At A Distance Of 8 Feet In Front Of The Tv, The Signal Breaks Even If You Move Your Head By 2-3 Inches.However, I Am Still Super Happy With This Tv. I Got It For 8K During The Launch Offer And It Is Totally Worth It And Is Recommended From My Side.,At This Price Range(‚Çπ11499/-)It Is Good Quality Product On This Market..Acer Only Should Work With Sound Quality Improvement Otherwise All Ok.Picture Quality Really Impressive,Wifi Connectivity Good,Easy To Install,Boderless Screen Design Is Premium And Also Google Voice Support Is Good(Sometimes Lagging).No Major Issues Found On This Tv.Just Go For It.,Vellu For Money.

But Nobody Turned Up That Day And I Had To Reschedule It For Tuesday Morning, And Even Today Nobody Turned Up. I Got A Call From Amazon To Reschedule It For Tuesday Evening And Still, Nobody Turned Up.This Is Very Very Bad And Irresponsible Service By Oneplus And Amazon. I'M Very Disappointed With The Service And Highly Criticize This Behavior. A Company Should Always Take Care Of Its Customer Satisfaction And You Have Failed In Doing This.What Do You Guys Expect Us To Do? Wait For 5 To 6 Days To Get My Tv Installed Even When It'S Been Delivered And Wait For You Guys To Come After So Many Days. Even When I'M Having My Smart Tv Delivered To My Home, I Have To Wait And Not Enjoy It Because You Guys Have Not Done Your Job Properly.At Least Keep Some Decency And Respect The Customers Who Are Paying A Big Amount And Ordering A Big Item From Your Company. You Should Take Care That The Money I Spent Has Been Worth It And Not Facing Any Issues. Highly Disappointed With This Behavior And Service.,Good Product,Connectivity Is Faster,But Performance Is Little Bit Slower,,The Biggest Problem I Face Is It Don'T Have A Aux Cable So I'M Not Able To Connect My Sound Bar......The Hdmi Port Is Useless It Won'T Work .So,I Connect It Via Bluetooth But The Problem Is That It Won'T Connect Automatically, Everytime I On The Tv I Need To Connect It Manually It'S A Basic Feature Which Is Not Provided In This Tv Then Another Drawback Is That It Was Fast At The Beginning Now It'S Been 4 Months And It'S Super Laggy .....Even After The Update Its Just The Same.....Yeaa But In This Price Range The Picture Quality Is Outstanding......That'S All,Good Quality In Picture And Volume Is Little Bit Low Other Than That Product Is Nice.

Value For Money.,Value For Money,Improvements Needed,Everything Thing Good Except The Installation Experience,Overall Taking All Aspects Tv Is Good Within The Price Point,Tv Installation Services,One Among The Good Tvs In The Market.,Picture","I Am Posting This After A Few Weeks Of Using The Product.Usage: Continuous, Ott Only, No Cable/Dish Operator.Average Daily Usage: 6-8 Hours.The Tv Is A Great Value-For-Money Product.Installation: The Installation Was Simple And Amazon Assisted Installation Was Smooth, Timely And Hassle-Free.Picture: The Picture Quality Is Not Great When Compared With The Smoothness Of A Sony, Lg And Samsung With These Kind Of Specs. Movies And Especially Hi-Res Tv Series Experience Was Somewhat Diluted As Most Of The Times, The Output, While In Hi-Res , Wouldn'T Look Like A Movie Quality Which We Are Used To Of Watching In The Likes Of Sony, Samsung Lg Etc However, With Time, You Get Used To It And Only Realize The Difference When You See The Same Movie At Someone Else'S Better Tv.Sound: Sound Output Is Decent. You Wouldn'T Need Additional Support To Enhance The Volume As Such.Remote: Sleek, Sensitive And User-Friendly. It'S Exactly Like Amazon'S Remote.Os: Same As Any Smart Android Tv. Works Smoothly Without Much Lags Or Hiccups. Switching Apps From One To Another Takes A A Couple Of Seconds More Than Sony But Unless You Have Used To Of Those Performances, It Looks Just Fine.Standalone And As Your First Smart Tv,  You Wouldn'T Find Any Reasons To Not Like The Quality And It Would Like Hi-Res From The Beginning. It Is A Great Value For Money Product Without A Doubt.However, If You Are Considering This As An Alternative Or Second Tv After Owning The Better Ones In The Past, You Will Have A Hard Time Adjusting With It.,Picture Quality Is Good For This Price, Didn‚ÄôT Faced Any Lag On Ui And Browsing Other Apps. Only Negative Will Be Audio, Definitely Need A Sound Bar If U Are A Frequent Movie Watcher. Overall Worth For Money U Spend. But The Installation Process Is Just Awful, Amazon Claiming That A Trained Professional Will Visit For Installation But Neither They Are Trained Nor Professionals , Just Read The Installation Manuals And Installed The Wall Mount Which Took 4Hours For Them To Buy The Wall Mount After Charging Money. No Demo Given On Tv As They Have No Idea About The Product, These Things Making To Think Twice Or Thrice To Buy A Tv Through Online.,Screen Looks Amazing But Problem Is With Processor I Believe. If 4K Content Is Getting Streamed On Device Then We Can Observe The Green Screen Flickers(Not So Often But Problem Exists), Even Remote Control Is Not Good As It Take At Least 2 Sec To React For The User Action.Reason Why I Believe Processor Is Bad Because I Do 4K Gaming Using Ps5 And Never Encountered Problem With The Screen.,If You Buy Tv In A Small Town Shop, It Will Be Delivered And Installed Immediately Within Couple Of Hours. When You Want To Buy A Tv From Amazon, You Need To Wait For It To Be Delivered For Couple Of Days And It Is Understandable. The Problem Is With The Installation, They Take So Much Time To Install That You End Up Regretting Buying The Product. It‚ÄôS Like You Are Hungry And Food Is In Front Of You But You Can‚ÄôT Eat. So I Ordered My Tv On Monday, It Got Delivered On Friday And It Will Be Installed On Monday Because Of Weekend Where As There Is No Concept Of Weekend In Small Towns. If We Had The Technician Details, We Could Reach Out  S Get It Installed But That Also Will Be Shared 4 Hours Before.Regarding Product, It‚ÄôS Good Quality And Very Good For A Average User. Heavy Duty Like Games And Continuous Usage On Some Store Will Be Challenging, I Guess.,This Tv Gives Good Results Within The Budget, Should Definitely Buy If The Budget Is 30K But Most Important Point Like To Mention Is After Sales Service And Also The Installation Part.1) The Installation Guy Didn‚ÄôT Arrive At Very First Day That Was Scheduled, Even After Rescheduling He Didn‚ÄôT Came For Installation Purpose. So Strictly Be Aware Of This Point.2) The Tv I Got In Offer With 3K Discount On Icici Card But Although The Product Came Out Defective, It Had Dead Pixel On The Display Which Is Very Bad After Period Of Time.3) Even After The Fault Was From Seller As It Was Defective Piece I Didn‚ÄôT Got The Replacement For The Product And It‚ÄôS Totally Unfair Deal By Amazon And The Seller Too.Final Verdict Is The Tv Quality And Feature Are Good But The Service From Seller And Amazon That Is Got Was Very Poor Inspite I Was Prime Member. The Seller Dawntech Electronics Private Limited Gives Very Poor Service And Feel Bad That In Such Cases Amazon Will Not Help You. Thankyou,Team,Also To Be Added Tv Installation Services With Product While Delivering And Unboxing. No Need To Other Sub-Vendor To Getting Installation And Demo. Also Dependency On Third-Party Involvement Should Be Less.Bad Experience With Tv Installation Stuff.Pls Look Into This .,Picture Quality Good. Sound Quality  Not Upto My 3Xpectations.

Here'S A Quick Fact For The User'S Complaining About The Less Cost To Benefits Ratio, Guys If You Buy A Android Tv Box Alone Which Has Processing Capacity Similar To This Tv, Then It Would Alone Cost You More Than 5K Rupees & Here You Get This Tv With That Android Setup With Various Other Feature Under 15K. So Just Check Once, What Options You Have Before Complaining.Eventually I Bought This Tv, Since I Was Already Using 4A 43 Version For Months And Wanted Smaller Version For Bedroom. Now After Using This Tv For Over 3 Weeks, I Am Stating My Detailed User Experience. Its A Detailed & Huge Review, But Do Read It, If You Want To Invest This Much Amount.‚óè‚óè If You Want To Get Quick Overview Of The Device, Then Read Below Else Scroll Down For Detailed Review ‚óè‚óè# Firstly Its Budget Friendly & Only Smart Tv Under 15K In The Current Market.# Has Most Number Of Output Port ( 1*Av, 3*Hdmi, 2*Usb ).# Has Android 8.1 Out Of The Box Along With Inbuilt Bluetooth# Has Dual Interface - Mi Patchwall & Android Tv ( I Mostly Prefer Android Tv Interface )# Remote Has Bluetooth & Voice Search With Sleek Profile.# Has Better Processor Compared To Predecessor Along With 1Gb Ram + 8Gb Storage ( 4.7Gb Actual )# Speaker Output Is Low.# Need Ir Cable For Using Set Top Box With Android Interface.# Amazon Prime & Netflix Is Not Preloaded, But Can Be Side Loaded.# Native Display Is Only Hd, Though 1080P & Even 4K Videos From Youtube Works Well (Check Images Attached).# Can Install & Play Tons Of High Quality Games Like Rr3, Etc (Check Images Attached).# Finally Smartphone Mirroring Works Fine Most Of The Time.Full Detailed Review :---->Built Quality :------------------# Has Combination Of Plastic And Aluminium For The Main Body. Its Not Great, But Above Average.# Table Top Stands Looks Bit Flimsy, But Are Workable.* The Screws Which Are Provided In The Box, Does Not Fits The Tv Perfectly, So I Bought New From Local Store.# It Has Averagely Slim Profile, Not The Slimmest In The Market.# Speaker Placement Is Inconvenient. Since They Are Placed At The Bottom, So When You Keep It On Table Top, The Sound Tends To Dampen And Bulge.# Has Good Ventilation For Electronics And It Hardly Heats Up.# Overall Built Quality Is Above Average.Display Quality :---------------------# It Has Very Thin Bezels, Which Looks Great.# Video Resolution Is 1366X768P, But 1080P Videos Works Fine On It.* 4K Videos On Youtube Runs Smoothly As Well.# Viewing Angle Are Good Compared To Price. ( Check The Images Attached )# Contrast Is Above Average, Brightness Is Good And Colours Are Quite Vivid.# Display Quality Is Also Above Average, Not Very Great.Remote Control :-----------------------# Its Very Sleek And Compact.# Has Only 7 Buttons And Is Easy To Operate.# Fortunately It Has Volume Buttons, Which Is Handy. ( I Have Couple Of Android Tv Boxes Without Volume Button On Remote, So I Know The Pain Of Using Mouse To Adjust The Volume :P )# Placement Of Voice Search Button Is Improper. Its Just Below Power Button, And I End Up Pressing Power Button A Lot.# Finally Its Bluetooth, So No Need To Point It Towards Tv For Operation.Other Features :---------------------# It Has Dual Interface, I.E. Patchwall And Android Tv.  Has Tons Of Content.# Many Games Can Be Installed (Till You Have Memory Left), Including Multiplayer Games.# Google Voice Search Is Very Useful, If You Don'T Want To Use Keyboard.# Processing Speed Is Fast And I Haven'T Detected Any Lags Yet. ( Lags In Streaming Can Be Due To Slow Internet Speed, Not Due To Hardware )# Bluetooth And Wifi Connectivity Works Perfectly.Cons :------# Speaker Output Though Rated 20W, Is Not Upto The Mark. My 16W Jbl Speakers Has Better And Louder Sound.# Placement Of Speaker Is Inconvenient, As In Table Top Position, Speakers Face The Table And Sound Dampens.# Internal Memory Is Very Less.# No Netflix And Amazon Prime Pre Loaded, Though You Can Side Load Them.# Miracast Not Supported. Even Normal Smartphone Mirroring Lags Sometimes.# Native Resolution Is Just 720P Hd, Though The 1080P Videos Works On Usb & 4K On Youtube.# Screen Is Slightly Reflective, Its Similar To Almost All The Other Led Tv'S.# Mixed Experiences Of After Sales Service.Customer Care :--------------------# Firstly The Installation Is A Joke. My Installation Was Scheduled 16 Days After My Product Delivery And The Fun Part Is, There'S Only 10 Days Replacement Window For This Product :P# Company Only Takes Replacement If The Product Is Opened By Their Representative, So There'S No Point Of Return Window Time Frame.# Mi Has Mixed Reviews For Repairs And Services. Though I Have Not Encountered Any Problem With Any Mi Tv Yet, I Have Had Issues With Other Mi Products And Service Center Near Me Is Always Very Helpful.Verdict :-----------Considering All The Facts, If You Are Fine With Above Average Display Quality, Want A Smart Tv And If You Have Tight Budget, Then This The Tv You Should Certainly Go For. Trust Me, You Won'T Get Any Better Deal Than This Least For Coming Couple Of Months. If You Have Higher Budget, Then Certainly Explore Brands Like Sony, Samsung, Etc.This Is Not A Perfect Smart Tv, But For The Given Price And 2 Years Of Warranty, Its No Brainer To Choose This, Its Certainly Worth The Investment.,This Television Is Definitely A Perfect Balance Between Price And Performance Especially During Flash Sale At An Exceptional Price Of ‚Çπ12500.Performance ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê-----------------------The Processor In This Smart Tv Is Powerful Enough To Play 4K 10Bit Hevc Videos Right Out Of The Box. Vlc Or Mx Player Can Be Installed For Enhanced Media Support.Picture Quality ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê--------------------------Many People Complain About The Overbright Screen. But It Can Be Compensated By Adjusting The Display Settings.These Are My Preferred Settings.Backlight :1 To 20*********************During Night Even The Lowest Value Of 1 Is  Bright Enough And Can Watch Content Without Hurting Eyes.During Day Time Adjust It As Per Your Requirement Depending On Your Ambient Lighting Conditions. A Maximum Of 20 Would Be Enough.Setting Backlight To Minimum Improves Black Levels, Reduces Power Consumption, Increases Led Life And Reduces Eye Strain Especially During Night.Brightness :48*****************Brightness Setting Controls Black Level.Increasing Brightness Reduces Black Levels And Hence Reduces Contrast.Brightness At 50, Pictures Looks Washed Out With Poor Blacks And Color Saturationat 45 Black Looks Deep But Lots Of Details At Dark Areas Are Lost While Watching Movies.48 Is An Optimal Setting To My Eyes With Good Blacks And Not So Lack Of Details.Contrast : 40 To 45*********************Contrast Setting Controls White Level.Contrast Can Be Set Anywhere Between 40 And 45. Increasing Contrast Too Much May Cause Highlight Areas In A Picture, Like Bright Skies Or Shiny Objects Might Look Overexposed. As The Screen Itself Is Very Bright, Increasing Contrast Further Makes Whites Look Over Bright. Also Colors Gets Washed Out While Increasing Contrast.Saturation: 45 To 50************************Color Saturation Can Be Set Anywhere Between 45 To 50. At 45 Colors Look More Natural. At 50 Colors Looks A Bit Punchy. But Still Its A Personal Preference.At The Above Settings, The Black Levels And Colors Were Pleasing While Watching Demo Videos Of Oled Tvs On Youtube At 1080P . The Following Youtube Videos Help You To Check The Black Level Quality Of The Tv.Lg 4K Oled Beauty Of Black Demolg Oled Eclipse 2 Demolg Hd Demo Art Nouveaufull Hd And 4K Videos Looks Sharp In This Tv. Downloaded A Sample 4K Hevc Video Named 'Life Untouched' And Also A 4K Hevc Sample Of The Movie Elysium. Both Of Them Played Smoothly On The Tv With Very Good Details.Screen Quality ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê--------------------------I Think This Is A Va Panel , The Quality Of Which Sits Right In Between Tn And Ips Panels. The Screen Is Glossy And Hence Reflective. This Might Be A Problem If The Tv Is Placed In A Room With Windows Facing It.Like All Other Lcd Panels, This Also Has Also Got Uneven Screen Uniformity But That'S Only Noticed In Plain Dark Grey Backgrounds. While Watching Movies Or Other Content It'S Not At All A Problem. Screen Non Uniformity Is A Common Issue Even With High End Tvs Of Big Brands Like Lg Samsung Etc.Luckily There'S No Backlight Bleeding In The Unit  I Received.Viewing Angles Are Average With Some Loss Of Contrast Even At Low Angles But That'S A Common Va Panel Characteristic. Ips Panels With Good Viewing Angles Can'T Be Expected At This Price Point.All Lcd Panel Technologies Have Their Strengths And Weaknesses. Ips Panels Have Good Viewing Angles But Has Poor Black Levels. Va Panels Excels In Black Depth Despite It'S Average Viewing Angles And This Tv Has Got Very Impressive Black Levels.Sound Quality ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê--------------------------Bass Is A Bit Weak (I Think Bass Is Improved Following Some Updates. So Giving 5 Stars From 4.) It'S Very Loud Even At Low Volume. Midrange And Treble Are Very Good. Even Minute High Pitched Click And Tick Sounds In Movies Can Be Heard Very Clearly.Edit:In A Previous Review I Have Mentioned These Eq Settings Sounds Good. But It Isn'T.100Hz : 7300Hz : 81000Hz : 43500 Hz : 610000 Hz : 5A High Value Of 8 For 300 Hz Actually Make The Sound Muddy And Muffled.The Following Settings Sounds Much Better And Here'S The Reason.100 Hz : 8 - Bassfrequency Setting For Deep Bass Male Vocals And Instruments Like Kick Drum,Toms, Snare Etc.300 Hz : 4 - Low Midrangeenhances Bass And Depth Of Male Vocals. Increasing 300Hz Too Much Makes Sounds Muddy And Muffled Reducing Clarity Of High Frequency Sounds1000 Hz : 3 - Midrangeimparts A Metallic Tone. Increasing Makes Sound Tinny And Unpleasant.3500 Hz : 5 - Upper Midrangevocals Especially Female Sounds Best At This Frequency. A Value Of 5 Enhances Vocal Quality. Increasing Too Much Makes Vocals Harsh.10000 Hz : 7 -Trebleadds Crispiness And Sparkle To Vocals And Instruments. Enhances Tinkling  Sounds Of Metallic  Instruments.Human Ear Is Sensitive To Midrange And Upper Midrange Frequencies Here It'S 1000 And 3500 Hz. Setting These Values Too High Can Cause Listening Fatigue. Even Increasing 300Hz Is Disturbing.Great Sound Performance Especially Bass Is Not Even Expected From A Television In This Budget. But Considering Its Midrange Frequency, Clear Treble And Loudness, It Deserves 4 Stars.Remote Control ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê-----------------------------Minimalism Is Great. But Minimalism With Less Functionality Is Not So Great. Addition Ofmute,Tv Settings And Video Input Selection Buttons Would 'Ve Made The Remote More Functional.App Support ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê(Update)-----------------------When The Tv Was Released There Was No Support For Netflix And Amazon Prime. But Now With Pie Update It Supports Both Netflix And Amazon Prime. Now The Tv Deserves 5 Stars For App Support.Pros And Cons--------------------------- Pros:1. Powerful Processor For 4K Media Playback.2. App Installation Via Usb3. Built In Chromecast4. Bluetooth Remote5. Voice Commandcons: (Update)Previously The Main Issues With The Tv Were The Lack Of Autoplay Function And Standby Option.But In The Latest Update Both These Issues Are Solved.Now When The Tv Is Turned On It Will Automatically Go To The Previous Input Sourceto Enable It, Go To Settngs >Inputs > Enable 'Stay On The Previous Source' Option.Screen Off Feature Is Also Added In The New Update. Long Pressing Power Button Will Show Screen Off Option.The Only Disadvantage Left On The Tv Was Lack Of Miracast. But On A Latest Update Build Pi.4316 Miracast Is Included And Now Its Perfect.To Sum Up:--------------------Overall Considering The Picture Quality, Powerful Hardware And The Price, The Tv Definitely Deserve 5 Stars Devoid Of It'S Average Audio Quality And The Glossy Screen Because There Are No Other Tvs In Market With Such Features At This Price Point. Also Xiaomi Now Has Got Very Strong Service Support Across India.New Brands Like Iffalcon, Blaupunkt ,Thomson Etc Might Provide Better Options At A Competitive Price. But When It Comes To Service Centres, It'S A Dead End.I Am Very Much Satisfied With The Purchase.,It'S Good Product,Good,If You Like A Best Tv On Your Budget I'Ll Recommend You This Stunning Picture Quality And Dts Surround Is Osm But There Was A Few Lagging Problem And Miracast Is Not Good üôÅ,Build Quality Good.Sound And Bass Excellent.,Product Is Very Good.

I Listed My Priorities Under Various Heads To Come Up With A Conclusion And Let Us Compare The Actual Product Based Upon My Initial Requirements:1.) Data Exchange:*****************************Since It Was To Be Primarily Used For Fast Mobile Devices Charging In Car, Data Exchange Capability Was Not Much Of My Concern. Preference Though Would Surely Have Been A Usb 3 But It Didn‚ÄôT Bother Me If I Could Only Get A Usb 2.0 Too.Actual Product: I Did Try To Copy A Movie File Just For The Sake Of Testing Data Exchange And I Found It To Be Pretty Well. I Did Not Capture Any Speed Data But Then We All Know Speed Of Data Transfer Also Varies With The Type Of Data Being Transferred. The More Variety Of Data Being Transferred Simultaneously The Lower Will Be The Speed.2.) Length Of The Cable :**************************************Again Since I Could Not Afford To Have A Lengthy Loop Of Cable Bunched Around My Gear Knob, I Preferred To Keep It Short & Simple Hence My Only Lookout Was Upto Around A Meter Or Below.Actual Product: The Cable Came Nicely Packed In A Paper Packet And Was Precisely 0.9 Meters Or Approximately 3 Feet Long. The Length Was Sufficient For Me To Plug-In Any Of The Mobile Devices To My Car Charger At The Drivers Or The Side Passenger‚ÄôS Seat.3.) Tangle Free/ Flexibility/ Strength Standards:**************************************************************************I Am Not Particularly A Fan Of Those Stubborn Braided Wires Which Are So Hard That They Retain The Shape In Which They Are Bent. I Wanted Something That Was Thick Yet Flexible Enough To Acquire A Circular Shape When Bunched.Actual Product: The Cable Received Looked Exactly As Shown Over The Site With Good Flexibility , Reasonable Thickness & A Sturdy Intermediate Cable. The Whole Construction Of The Cable Due It‚ÄôS Cable Size & Flexibility Is Almost Tangle-Free.The Associated Cable Was Not Exactly Thick But Can‚ÄôT Be Termed As Thin Or Delicate Too. It‚ÄôS Not The Thickest I‚ÄôVe Seen But Then Thickest Doesn‚ÄôT Always Means Most Durable. Given My Application It‚ÄôS More Than Just Suitable.The Overall Built & Quality Of The Cable & Insulation Looks Promising Enough To Last Few Years. Even If Used For Other Than Car Charging It Looks Durable Enough To Last Long.I Had Further Shortlisted Mansaa & An Amkette Cable For The Same Purpose But They Were Too Long For My Requirement.4.) Compact Moulded Connectors:*********************************************************Had An Inclination Towards Moulded Connectors To Avoid Any Issues Where The Connectors Break Open Exposing The Terminal Pcbs.Actual Product : There Are No Complaints Regarding The Connectors Of The Actual Cable. The Connectors Are Perfectly Moulded Without Any Joints Or Risks Of Splitting Open. The Connector Casings Are Further Quite Compact At Terminals To Fit In Comfortably At Scarce Spaces.The Connector Ports Are Sturdy Enough Both At Usb A & Micro B Ports. The Micro B Port Pins Lock Securely Onto The Charging Mobile Devices Which Is Quite Good.No Signs Of Loose Construction.Being Gold-Plated Is More Of A Misleading & Fancy Term(In This Case) As Most Of The Metal Ports Designed Today Already Have A Corrosion Resistance & Nobody Is Going To Use Them In Saline Sea Water Anyways.5.)

I Got This Device Up And Running With Ubuntu 22.04 With Linux 5.15.0-56-Generic.Google Search For ""Morrownr/8821Au-20210708"" And Use The Driver On Github. I'M Using The Product ""Tp-Link Ac600"" Btw. If You Are Using The Other Variant Sold On Amazon, Use Lsusb And Find Out Which Network Interface You Are Going To Have To Install Drivers For. Giyf.I Will Admit, This Is Probably Going To Be Hard For Someone Who Is Not Generally Comfortable With A Shell, Bash For Example. But Even Though I Had Never Used Dkms Or Iw Before, The Github Repo Along With The Build Tools Available In The Jammy Repo Made It Easy Enough To Get The Device Working (Read The Github Readme).To Be Sure I First Got The Drivers Working In A Local Ubuntu Vm Using Guest Additions To Connect To The Usb Device Directly From The Guest Os, Which Also Worked.Ultimately, I Installed The Os On The Host And Setup The Drivers Using Usb Tethering. I Then Got The Same Download Speed Using This Device I Was Previously Getting On My Other Network Interfaces On Windows And Mac, But Now On Ubuntu.The Device Itself Is A Bit Sensitive To The Antenna Direction When It Comes To The Impact On Download Speed. Have Been Using For About A Month Now Without Complaints.,Do Not Go For Reviews That Say That It Do Not Support Kali. Me And Some Of My Friends All Are Using It For Wi-Fi Hacking And It Works Really Well, It Also Supports Monitor Mode. If You Are Having Issues In Connecting It To Your Kali Machine Then Just Go Through The Web Surf A Bit And You Will Find Relevant Articles On How To Connect This Tp Link Adapter To Your Kali Machine. There Is Also A Driver Of Realtek Which You Might Need To Install To Make It Work In Your Kali Machine.I Have Given It 4 Stars Just Because The Performance If Not Good As The Alpha Adapters Which Is Reasonable For This Range Of Price But In This Range And For As A Beginner It Is The Best Adapter You Can Buy.,Nice Product. Working Fine. My Pc Is Now 5G  Price Is Too High So Giving 4 Star,Got The Wi-Fi In One Of The Rooms From 0 To 70%. Has Been Working Well Since A Month Now. Good Alternative To A Repeater If Only A Single Device Needs To Access The Wi-Fi From A Corner.,The Product Is Very Nice And Have Good Wifi Signal. Using This For Over A Month Now, No Complain. But When It For The First Time, You Need To Install The Driver On Your Desktop/Laptop From The Tp Link Website To Make It Operational, Which Is Not Very Well Explained In The Manual.,This Product Is Very Good,I Have Buy This Product Because My Laptop Don‚ÄôT Support Wifi 5Ghz Band, In 2.5 Ghz I Receive 30-40Mbps Speed Only But My Broadband Plan Is 150Mbps.1. Easy To Use Plug And Play Windows 102. Good Signal I Am Using Another Room From Router No Signal Drop , I Receive Full Signal.3. Little Bit Expensive But Go With This Because Of Good Signal.4.

I Listed My Priorities Under Various Heads To Come Up With A Conclusion And Let Us Compare The Actual Product Based Upon My Initial Requirements:1.) Data Exchange:*****************************Since It Was To Be Primarily Used For Fast Mobile Devices Charging In Car, Data Exchange Capability Was Not Much Of My Concern. Preference Though Would Surely Have Been A Usb 3 But It Didn‚ÄôT Bother Me If I Could Only Get A Usb 2.0 Too.Actual Product: I Did Try To Copy A Movie File Just For The Sake Of Testing Data Exchange And I Found It To Be Pretty Well. I Did Not Capture Any Speed Data But Then We All Know Speed Of Data Transfer Also Varies With The Type Of Data Being Transferred. The More Variety Of Data Being Transferred Simultaneously The Lower Will Be The Speed.2.) Length Of The Cable :**************************************Again Since I Could Not Afford To Have A Lengthy Loop Of Cable Bunched Around My Gear Knob, I Preferred To Keep It Short & Simple Hence My Only Lookout Was Upto Around A Meter Or Below.Actual Product: The Cable Came Nicely Packed In A Paper Packet And Was Precisely 0.9 Meters Or Approximately 3 Feet Long. The Length Was Sufficient For Me To Plug-In Any Of The Mobile Devices To My Car Charger At The Drivers Or The Side Passenger‚ÄôS Seat.3.) Tangle Free/ Flexibility/ Strength Standards:**************************************************************************I Am Not Particularly A Fan Of Those Stubborn Braided Wires Which Are So Hard That They Retain The Shape In Which They Are Bent. I Wanted Something That Was Thick Yet Flexible Enough To Acquire A Circular Shape When Bunched.Actual Product: The Cable Received Looked Exactly As Shown Over The Site With Good Flexibility , Reasonable Thickness & A Sturdy Intermediate Cable. The Whole Construction Of The Cable Due It‚ÄôS Cable Size & Flexibility Is Almost Tangle-Free.The Associated Cable Was Not Exactly Thick But Can‚ÄôT Be Termed As Thin Or Delicate Too. It‚ÄôS Not The Thickest I‚ÄôVe Seen But Then Thickest Doesn‚ÄôT Always Means Most Durable. Given My Application It‚ÄôS More Than Just Suitable.The Overall Built & Quality Of The Cable & Insulation Looks Promising Enough To Last Few Years. Even If Used For Other Than Car Charging It Looks Durable Enough To Last Long.I Had Further Shortlisted Mansaa & An Amkette Cable For The Same Purpose But They Were Too Long For My Requirement.4.) Compact Moulded Connectors:*********************************************************Had An Inclination Towards Moulded Connectors To Avoid Any Issues Where The Connectors Break Open Exposing The Terminal Pcbs.Actual Product : There Are No Complaints Regarding The Connectors Of The Actual Cable. The Connectors Are Perfectly Moulded Without Any Joints Or Risks Of Splitting Open. The Connector Casings Are Further Quite Compact At Terminals To Fit In Comfortably At Scarce Spaces.The Connector Ports Are Sturdy Enough Both At Usb A & Micro B Ports. The Micro B Port Pins Lock Securely Onto The Charging Mobile Devices Which Is Quite Good.No Signs Of Loose Construction.Being Gold-Plated Is More Of A Misleading & Fancy Term(In This Case) As Most Of The Metal Ports Designed Today Already Have A Corrosion Resistance & Nobody Is Going To Use Them In Saline Sea Water Anyways.5.) Availability Of Ties/Velcro Straps :***********************************************************As Per My Intended Use In A Car Where Compactness Was Of Paramount Importance, I Expected An Included Cable Tie Or A Velcro Strap Would Be A Nice Add-On To Properly Adjust & Arrange The Cable As Per Requirement.Actual Product: This I Miss The Most In The Provided Actual Cable, There Is No Provision Of An Included Strap Or Cable Tie Through Which I Could Adjust My Required Cable Length Easily.6.) Decent Current Handling Capability:******************************************************************On The Newest Qc 3.0 Certified Chargers The Current Transmission Can Go Up To 3.4 Amps In Certain Cases Hence The Cable Needed To Have A Decent Current Handling Ability.Actual Product : The Actual Cable Has A Nameplate Rating Of Handling Up To 2.1 Amps Against Demands At New Qc 3.0 Chargers That Could Go Up To 3.4 Amps. Here, Let Me Clear Out That The Latest Qc Chargers Vary Voltage To Current Ratios To Achieve Desired Fast Charging  & Thus It Is Not Like A Continuous Flow Of 3.4 Amps Is There, It Keeps On Reducing Hence Cable Ratings Designed For A Continuous Current Handling Of Anything Above 2.0 Amps Would Sufficiently Work With Qc 3.0 Chargers.Have Tried It Safely Multiple Times Charging My Samsung S7 From 10 % Without The Cable Getting Hot.7.) Warranty:************************Comes With A 1 Year Warranty As Expected. Not The Best In The Industry But Reasonable.Other Observations:*************************************Apart From The Above Listed Features, The Other Details Of The Actual Product Received Worth Mentioning Are:8.) The Cable Is Manufactured In China & Imported By Amazon Warehouse Dealers Under The Brand Name & Philosophy Of Amazonbasics.9.) The Cable Has A Manufacturing Date Of Oct 2017 & It Was Imported To India In Dec 2017.10.)

Picture Quality And Sound Quality Is Good.I Added Firestick To It And It Voila Became Smart Tv. The Connections To Attach These Usbs Are At The Bottom Part Of The Tv Which Is Slightly Different From Other Tvs.So Far, Working As It Should.Revising This After 9 Days, The Tv Is Not Responding To Switch Off Button. This Is Happening More When I Watch The Tv For A Few Hours And Then When I Switch Off The Tv With The Firestick Remote, The Yellow Colour Indicator Down Below Does Not Turn Red, Instead It Remains Yellow. As Far As Screen Is Concerned, The Tv'S Screen Changes To Black Whitish, Seems To Me That The Tv Goes Into Hibernation Or Sleep Mode. This Is A Fault Of The Tv As A Normal Tv Should Swith Off Completely And The Indicator Should Turn Red. I Have Called Technician Tomorrow And If He Checks And If He Agrees, Then I Should Get A Replacement As I Got Still 2 Days Time To Replace It.Just A Helping Note For People Buying This Tv: If You Are Going To Connect Firestick To It, As It Asks For The Brand Name Of The Tv, You Can Select Vu And It Will Perfectly Work On Your Firestick.

Size And Slim - It Is Slim And Looks Stylish. Very Light Weight And Handy To Install.3. Easy To Install And Mount To Wall.4.

It Is Easily Installable And Sign-In To Start Using Quickly.8. It Is Also Easy To Scan The Setup Box Channels And Start Viewing Them.Cons:-1. Picture Quality Is 776P. It'S Average And Not Very Clear. But It Is Worth The Price Range. I'Ll Not Complaint As The Cost Of Tv Is Very Affordable And This Quality Is Justified.2. Bluetooth And Wifi Connection Can Disconnect Sometimes And Cause Some Issues.

This Tv Will Not Give Good Experience For Sports Due To Less Picture Quality But It'S Very Good For Daily Family Shows And Tv Channels.One Last Thing I Want To Express And I'M Ver Disappointed About Is This.I Got My Order Delivered On Friday And I Scheduled My Installation For Saturday. But Nobody Turned Up That Day And I Had To Reschedule It For Tuesday Morning, And Even Today Nobody Turned Up. I Got A Call From Amazon To Reschedule It For Tuesday Evening And Still, Nobody Turned Up.This Is Very Very Bad And Irresponsible Service By Oneplus And Amazon. I'M Very Disappointed With The Service And Highly Criticize This Behavior. A Company Should Always Take Care Of Its Customer Satisfaction And You Have Failed In Doing This.What Do You Guys Expect Us To Do? Wait For 5 To 6 Days To Get My Tv Installed Even When It'S Been Delivered And Wait For You Guys To Come After So Many Days. Even When I'M Having My Smart Tv Delivered To My Home, I Have To Wait And Not Enjoy It Because You Guys Have Not Done Your Job Properly.At Least Keep Some Decency And Respect The Customers Who Are Paying A Big Amount And Ordering A Big Item From Your Company. You Should Take Care That The Money I Spent Has Been Worth It And Not Facing Any Issues. Highly Disappointed With This Behavior And Service.,Good Product,Connectivity Is Faster,But Performance Is Little Bit Slower,,The Biggest Problem I Face Is It Don'T Have A Aux Cable So I'M Not Able To Connect My Sound Bar......The Hdmi Port Is Useless It Won'T Work .So,I Connect It Via Bluetooth But The Problem Is That It Won'T Connect Automatically, Everytime I On The Tv I Need To Connect It Manually It'S A Basic Feature Which Is Not Provided In This Tv Then Another Drawback Is That It Was Fast At The Beginning Now It'S Been 4 Months And It'S Super Laggy .....Even After The Update Its Just The Same.....Yeaa But In This Price Range The Picture Quality Is Outstanding......That'S All,Good Quality In Picture And Volume Is Little Bit Low Other Than That Product Is Nice. Budget Friendly, I'M Happy With This .,After A Few Days, The Tv Will Perform Slowly And The  Remote  Is Very Very Sentence,Thank You Amazon And Oneplus,1. Sound Is Good2. Easy Installation3.

Aue70 - I Knew I Wouldn'T Be Needing A Voice Assistant, And Wanted To Save 3K. I Knew Even If I Wanted A Voice Assistant, I Could Plug In Fire Tv/Mi Tv Box And Get Those Features Later On. Delivery Was Pretty Hassle Free, The Delivery Executive Unloaded The Tv In The Room I Asked For, And Opened The Box To Inspect The Tv For Any Physical Damages. Samsung Technicians Came In A Few Hours Later, Installed And Gave A Demo.Sound:Per Other Reviews - Sound From Speakers Is Apparently Bad, But In My Case, I Found It Satisfactory. I Have It Wall Mounted In A 10X12Ft Room, And The Tv'S Speakers Sound Better Compared To Bose Soundlink Speakers That I Connected It To Via Bluetooth.Picture:The Panel'S Great, But Nothing Worth Raving About. Gray Uniformity Isn'T Great(I.E. Gray Tones Won'T Be Perfectly Uniform Across The Whole Panel, There'Ll Be Darker Zones Towards The Edges/Corners Based On Backlight Placement). Blacks Aren'T Perfectly Black - And They'Re Brighter Than You'D Expect From A Va Panel, But This Isn'T Noticeable At All When The Room Is Lit. No Backlight Bleed. Colors Are As Good As I'D Like Them To Be, And The Panel Does Get Noticeably Bright For My Taste, Even When Brightness Is Turned Down To 40%. 720P Content Is Watchable From >8Ft, 1080P Is Good(I'D Say Better Than I Expected), And 4K Is Well, 4K.Connectivity:I Have A 35 Mb/S Broadband  Connection And All Content Streams In 4K When Available, Without Stutters. The Tv Has Bluetooth 5.0, And Works With Tws And Neckband Earphones Fine(I Use Oppo Enco W51 And Boat Rockerz 330) - There'S No Noticeable Latency, And Volume Can Be Controlled Through The Remote Itself.Apps & Features:Has All The Standard Slew Of Streaming Apps I Needed - Netflix, Hotstar, Prime, Apple Tv+ & Youtube. All Of Them Stream 4K Content, Except For Hotstar - Which Only Streamed 4K A Few Times. 1080P Is Still Very Watchable, And Not Really A Deal Breaker. No Dolby Vision Support - Which I Made My Peace With Considering The Fact That 99% Of Budget Tvs In The Market Can'T Produce The Contrast You'D Expect Out Of Dv Content Anyways, So Why Care. You Get Hdr, And Hdr Content Is Definitely Better Looking Than Non-Hdr Ones In Terms Of Colors And Vibrancy. I Planned To Use The Tv Without Cable, But The Tv Does Come With Some Channels Like Republic Tv, Bloomberg, 9Xm, Etc., These Stream In 1080P, So A Great Bonus To Have.Remote:Very Basic Rf Remote, Unlike Bluetooth Ones On Most New Tvs. The Remote'S Looks Pretty Sleek And Stylish, But That'S About It. Biggest Gripe - Typing To Search For Things Within Apps Is A Pain In The Behind, You'Ll Need To Use The D-Pad To Navigate On An On-Screen Keyboard. You Can Control The Tv Using Samsung'S Smartthings App, But Guess What - You Can'T Even Use Your Phone'S Keyboard To Type In When Controlling Through The App - This Is Something That Can Be Added Through An Update, But It'S Not There Yet.Attached Pictures Are All Of 4K Content. Resolution Might Get Scaled Down After I Submit The Review, But You Can Still Get An Idea Of The Tv'S Design/Looks, Panel Colors And Contrast, Etc.I'D Say I'M Really Happy - And Given The Chance, Wouldn'T Change My Decision. It'S A Samsung Tv, So End Of The Day, If It Produces A Decent Picture, And Lasts A Couple Of Years More Than I Expect, I Can Overlook All Other Cons. I'D Highly Recommend The Tv If You Have The Same Expectations From Your Next Tv.,,Placed Order On 18Th Dec'22 Received Defective Product, Updated To Amazon Service They Replaced With New Product Today(27/12/22).Will Post Long Term Review.Pros: Picture Quality, Design (Thin N Bezel Less)Cons: Sound (Bit Okay),Upsacling Of Sd Channelsover All Satisfied.,Have Been Using It Since Month Now.-Picture Quality Is Amazing. 4.5/5-As Always Installation Service From Samsung Was Seemless. 5/5-Smart Features Are Good This Model Don'T Have Voice Recognition.

Value For Money.,Value For Money,Improvements Needed,Everything Thing Good Except The Installation Experience,Overall Taking All Aspects Tv Is Good Within The Price Point,Tv Installation Services,One Among The Good Tvs In The Market.,Picture","I Am Posting This After A Few Weeks Of Using The Product.Usage: Continuous, Ott Only, No Cable/Dish Operator.Average Daily Usage: 6-8 Hours.The Tv Is A Great Value-For-Money Product.Installation: The Installation Was Simple And Amazon Assisted Installation Was Smooth, Timely And Hassle-Free.Picture: The Picture Quality Is Not Great When Compared With The Smoothness Of A Sony, Lg And Samsung With These Kind Of Specs. Movies And Especially Hi-Res Tv Series Experience Was Somewhat Diluted As Most Of The Times, The Output, While In Hi-Res , Wouldn'T Look Like A Movie Quality Which We Are Used To Of Watching In The Likes Of Sony, Samsung Lg Etc However, With Time, You Get Used To It And Only Realize The Difference When You See The Same Movie At Someone Else'S Better Tv.Sound: Sound Output Is Decent. You Wouldn'T Need Additional Support To Enhance The Volume As Such.Remote: Sleek, Sensitive And User-Friendly. It'S Exactly Like Amazon'S Remote.Os: Same As Any Smart Android Tv. Works Smoothly Without Much Lags Or Hiccups. Switching Apps From One To Another Takes A A Couple Of Seconds More Than Sony But Unless You Have Used To Of Those Performances, It Looks Just Fine.Standalone And As Your First Smart Tv,  You Wouldn'T Find Any Reasons To Not Like The Quality And It Would Like Hi-Res From The Beginning. It Is A Great Value For Money Product Without A Doubt.However, If You Are Considering This As An Alternative Or Second Tv After Owning The Better Ones In The Past, You Will Have A Hard Time Adjusting With It.,Picture Quality Is Good For This Price, Didn‚ÄôT Faced Any Lag On Ui And Browsing Other Apps. Only Negative Will Be Audio, Definitely Need A Sound Bar If U Are A Frequent Movie Watcher. Overall Worth For Money U Spend. But The Installation Process Is Just Awful, Amazon Claiming That A Trained Professional Will Visit For Installation But Neither They Are Trained Nor Professionals , Just Read The Installation Manuals And Installed The Wall Mount Which Took 4Hours For Them To Buy The Wall Mount After Charging Money. No Demo Given On Tv As They Have No Idea About The Product, These Things Making To Think Twice Or Thrice To Buy A Tv Through Online.,Screen Looks Amazing But Problem Is With Processor I Believe. If 4K Content Is Getting Streamed On Device Then We Can Observe The Green Screen Flickers(Not So Often But Problem Exists), Even Remote Control Is Not Good As It Take At Least 2 Sec To React For The User Action.Reason Why I Believe Processor Is Bad Because I Do 4K Gaming Using Ps5 And Never Encountered Problem With The Screen.,If You Buy Tv In A Small Town Shop, It Will Be Delivered And Installed Immediately Within Couple Of Hours. When You Want To Buy A Tv From Amazon, You Need To Wait For It To Be Delivered For Couple Of Days And It Is Understandable. The Problem Is With The Installation, They Take So Much Time To Install That You End Up Regretting Buying The Product. It‚ÄôS Like You Are Hungry And Food Is In Front Of You But You Can‚ÄôT Eat. So I Ordered My Tv On Monday, It Got Delivered On Friday And It Will Be Installed On Monday Because Of Weekend Where As There Is No Concept Of Weekend In Small Towns. If We Had The Technician Details, We Could Reach Out  S Get It Installed But That Also Will Be Shared 4 Hours Before.Regarding Product, It‚ÄôS Good Quality And Very Good For A Average User. Heavy Duty Like Games And Continuous Usage On Some Store Will Be Challenging, I Guess.,This Tv Gives Good Results Within The Budget, Should Definitely Buy If The Budget Is 30K But Most Important Point Like To Mention Is After Sales Service And Also The Installation Part.1) The Installation Guy Didn‚ÄôT Arrive At Very First Day That Was Scheduled, Even After Rescheduling He Didn‚ÄôT Came For Installation Purpose. So Strictly Be Aware Of This Point.2) The Tv I Got In Offer With 3K Discount On Icici Card But Although The Product Came Out Defective, It Had Dead Pixel On The Display Which Is Very Bad After Period Of Time.3) Even After The Fault Was From Seller As It Was Defective Piece I Didn‚ÄôT Got The Replacement For The Product And It‚ÄôS Totally Unfair Deal By Amazon And The Seller Too.Final Verdict Is The Tv Quality And Feature Are Good But The Service From Seller And Amazon That Is Got Was Very Poor Inspite I Was Prime Member. The Seller Dawntech Electronics Private Limited Gives Very Poor Service And Feel Bad That In Such Cases Amazon Will Not Help You. Thankyou,Team,Also To Be Added Tv Installation Services With Product While Delivering And Unboxing. No Need To Other Sub-Vendor To Getting Installation And Demo. Also Dependency On Third-Party Involvement Should Be Less.Bad Experience With Tv Installation Stuff.Pls Look Into This .,Picture Quality Good. Sound Quality  Not Upto My 3Xpectations.

The Technician Brought A Cheap Hanging Hook That Had Mrp Inr116 On It And Asked For Inr499 For It Without Any Receipt. He Kept Telling That It Was Not For Sale And Company Had Sent This Specially. However, It Clearly Had Mrp Mentioned On It2. I Went To Market And Bought A Much Better Cabinet For Just Inr200 And For Installation Of That As Well, Technician Was Really Adamant To Drill The Two Required Holes On Top. He Just Drilled One On Top And One On Bottom And Kept All The Other Spare Screws ( Which I Had Bought ) With Him. After About Half An Hour Of Arguments, He Finally Drilled The Other Required Holes. And For All This, He Kept Cussing Me That I Wasted His Time. There Was No Assistance From The Person Who Represented The Service Agency As Well.This Whole Process Took Me Two Hours To Complete That Too With Lots Of Arguments. This Was The Worst Installation Experience In My Life So Far.Bottomline - Please Do Not Avail The 'So Called Free' Installation Service From Amazon. It Is Just A Scam. Instead Call The Acer Support. They Will Do The Job Much Better.,After Using It For 2 Months, Here Are It'S Pros And Cons:Pros :1. Great Picture Quality. It'S Awesome.2. Blacks Are Very Good And Is Adjustable.3. Sound With 30Db Is Very Good4. Looks Great With Thin Besel5. Remote Comes With Favorite Ott Buttons.6. Content Upscaling Is Very Good.Cons:1. Remote Could Have Been Better. Can'T Use Dth Remote To Turn On Both Televisison And Set Top Box.2. Remote Operation Is Bit Complex.3. Motion Technology Not Great. There Is A Noticeable Blur When Watching Moving Ballson Ott, But It Decreases When You Switch To Dth.Overall, It'S A Nice Buy At This Price Point. I Think I Am Getting Fairly Better Picture Quality And Sound. I Am Satisfied With The Product.,Product Has Good Picture Quality. Good Product At That Price With 25W Sound. Applications Running Smoothly. 3 Months Older & No Issues Yet. It'S Running Smoothly.,You Get Decent Features For The Price You Pay. Screen Resolution Might Be. Set Back As You May Find Pixalation. Overall It'S Good,I Am Amazed With The Picture Quality Of This 720P (Hd Ready) Tv. It Is Truly An Amazing Panel. I Found It Suitable For A Viewing Distance Of Between 6 To 10 Feet. Any Nearer It May Not Look Very Crisp And Any Farther, It Will Feel Like A Very Small Size. The Speakers Are Also Very Good For The Price And Can Get Very Loud Without Any Distortions. However, Since The Speaker Is Downward Firing, The Experience Will Vary Based On Whether The Tv Is Wall Mounted Or Kept On A Stand.The Remote Is Good, Voice Search Works Well For Me. Tv Start Up Takes A Long Time In My Opinion, But I Have Not Compared It Against Any Other 32 Inch Tv And Hence Do Not Know Where It Stands Among Peers.5 Ghz Wifi Works Very Well Even Across Walls. Only Negative Aspect I Faced Is W.R.T The Experience Of Using My Bluetooth Headphones/Earphones. Firstly, The Connection Sometimes Doesn'T Happen Automatically After A  Restart - Which Means I Have To Remove And Re-Discover The Device Thru The Menu Which Is Not Simple. Secondly, The Signal Itself Seems To Be Very Weak And Even At A Distance Of 8 Feet In Front Of The Tv, The Signal Breaks Even If You Move Your Head By 2-3 Inches.However, I Am Still Super Happy With This Tv. I Got It For 8K During The Launch Offer And It Is Totally Worth It And Is Recommended From My Side.,At This Price Range(‚Çπ11499/-)It Is Good Quality Product On This Market..Acer Only Should Work With Sound Quality Improvement Otherwise All Ok.Picture Quality Really Impressive,Wifi Connectivity Good,Easy To Install,Boderless Screen Design Is Premium And Also Google Voice Support Is Good(Sometimes Lagging).No Major Issues Found On This Tv.Just Go For It.,Vellu For Money.

Samsung Is Always Good,Value For Money Product","Before Finalizing The Aue60 55"", I Visited Croma And Vijay Sales To Check For The Same Tv Or Similar Models For Their Features And Picture Quality. I Was Told Aue60 & Aue70(The Models Listed Here As Crystal 4K And 4K Pro) Are E-Commerce Exclusive Models, Not Available Offline. I Was Shown Au7700 Which Has The Same Processor, Panel And Features, But Was Listed At 65K For The 55"" Version. I Liked The Picture Quality, And Decided I'Ll Get The Aue60 Since It Shares So Much With Au7700, And Save ~20K.Why I Went For Aue60  Vs. Aue70 - I Knew I Wouldn'T Be Needing A Voice Assistant, And Wanted To Save 3K. I Knew Even If I Wanted A Voice Assistant, I Could Plug In Fire Tv/Mi Tv Box And Get Those Features Later On. Delivery Was Pretty Hassle Free, The Delivery Executive Unloaded The Tv In The Room I Asked For, And Opened The Box To Inspect The Tv For Any Physical Damages. Samsung Technicians Came In A Few Hours Later, Installed And Gave A Demo.Sound:Per Other Reviews - Sound From Speakers Is Apparently Bad, But In My Case, I Found It Satisfactory. I Have It Wall Mounted In A 10X12Ft Room, And The Tv'S Speakers Sound Better Compared To Bose Soundlink Speakers That I Connected It To Via Bluetooth.Picture:The Panel'S Great, But Nothing Worth Raving About. Gray Uniformity Isn'T Great(I.E. Gray Tones Won'T Be Perfectly Uniform Across The Whole Panel, There'Ll Be Darker Zones Towards The Edges/Corners Based On Backlight Placement). Blacks Aren'T Perfectly Black - And They'Re Brighter Than You'D Expect From A Va Panel, But This Isn'T Noticeable At All When The Room Is Lit. No Backlight Bleed. Colors Are As Good As I'D Like Them To Be, And The Panel Does Get Noticeably Bright For My Taste, Even When Brightness Is Turned Down To 40%. 720P Content Is Watchable From >8Ft, 1080P Is Good(I'D Say Better Than I Expected), And 4K Is Well, 4K.Connectivity:I Have A 35 Mb/S Broadband  Connection And All Content Streams In 4K When Available, Without Stutters. The Tv Has Bluetooth 5.0, And Works With Tws And Neckband Earphones Fine(I Use Oppo Enco W51 And Boat Rockerz 330) - There'S No Noticeable Latency, And Volume Can Be Controlled Through The Remote Itself.Apps & Features:Has All The Standard Slew Of Streaming Apps I Needed - Netflix, Hotstar, Prime, Apple Tv+ & Youtube. All Of Them Stream 4K Content, Except For Hotstar - Which Only Streamed 4K A Few Times. 1080P Is Still Very Watchable, And Not Really A Deal Breaker. No Dolby Vision Support - Which I Made My Peace With Considering The Fact That 99% Of Budget Tvs In The Market Can'T Produce The Contrast You'D Expect Out Of Dv Content Anyways, So Why Care. You Get Hdr, And Hdr Content Is Definitely Better Looking Than Non-Hdr Ones In Terms Of Colors And Vibrancy. I Planned To Use The Tv Without Cable, But The Tv Does Come With Some Channels Like Republic Tv, Bloomberg, 9Xm, Etc., These Stream In 1080P, So A Great Bonus To Have.Remote:Very Basic Rf Remote, Unlike Bluetooth Ones On Most New Tvs. The Remote'S Looks Pretty Sleek And Stylish, But That'S About It. Biggest Gripe - Typing To Search For Things Within Apps Is A Pain In The Behind, You'Ll Need To Use The D-Pad To Navigate On An On-Screen Keyboard. You Can Control The Tv Using Samsung'S Smartthings App, But Guess What - You Can'T Even Use Your Phone'S Keyboard To Type In When Controlling Through The App - This Is Something That Can Be Added Through An Update, But It'S Not There Yet.Attached Pictures Are All Of 4K Content. Resolution Might Get Scaled Down After I Submit The Review, But You Can Still Get An Idea Of The Tv'S Design/Looks, Panel Colors And Contrast, Etc.I'D Say I'M Really Happy - And Given The Chance, Wouldn'T Change My Decision. It'S A Samsung Tv, So End Of The Day, If It Produces A Decent Picture, And Lasts A Couple Of Years More Than I Expect, I Can Overlook All Other Cons. I'D Highly Recommend The Tv If You Have The Same Expectations From Your Next Tv.,,Placed Order On 18Th Dec'22 Received Defective Product, Updated To Amazon Service They Replaced With New Product Today(27/12/22).Will Post Long Term Review.Pros: Picture Quality, Design (Thin N Bezel Less)Cons: Sound (Bit Okay),Upsacling Of Sd Channelsover All Satisfied.,Have Been Using It Since Month Now.-Picture Quality Is Amazing. 4.5/5-As Always Installation Service From Samsung Was Seemless. 5/5-Smart Features Are Good This Model Don'T Have Voice Recognition.

I Got It In The Offer And It Was Totally Worth It.Pros:-1. Sound Is Awesome - 100% Satisfied With The Quality Of Sound. Dolby Audio 20W Speakers Are Really Great For Sure Affordable Tv.2. Size And Slim - It Is Slim And Looks Stylish. Very Light Weight And Handy To Install.3. Easy To Install And Mount To Wall.4. Tye Software Installation And Set Up Is Very Easy And Anyone Can Do It At Home.5. It Gets Integrated With Mobile Apps, Remote, Wifi Networks Very Quickly And Easily.6. The Overall Sign Up Process And App Installations Are Quick And Automatic.7. It Supports All The Smart Features Like Netflix, Prime And Youtube. It Is Easily Installable And Sign-In To Start Using Quickly.8. It Is Also Easy To Scan The Setup Box Channels And Start Viewing Them.Cons:-1. Picture Quality Is 776P. It'S Average And Not Very Clear. But It Is Worth The Price Range. I'Ll Not Complaint As The Cost Of Tv Is Very Affordable And This Quality Is Justified.2. Bluetooth And Wifi Connection Can Disconnect Sometimes And Cause Some Issues. I Encountered This Disconnect Issue And Had To Reset Complete Device And Do The Complete Sign Up Again.Rest All Is Very Good And Loved This Product. I Feel It Was Worth Ordering. If You Are Looking Something Is Medium Range And Only Need It For Your Old Parents And Don'T Have Extensive Smart Use Then 100% Go For This.If You Want To Use A Lot Of Smart Features And Ott Platforms And Watch Movies, And Sports Then Go For Better Version With Full Hd And 4K Quality. This Tv Will Not Give Good Experience For Sports Due To Less Picture Quality But It'S Very Good For Daily Family Shows And Tv Channels.One Last Thing I Want To Express And I'M Ver Disappointed About Is This.I Got My Order Delivered On Friday And I Scheduled My Installation For Saturday. But Nobody Turned Up That Day And I Had To Reschedule It For Tuesday Morning, And Even Today Nobody Turned Up. I Got A Call From Amazon To Reschedule It For Tuesday Evening And Still, Nobody Turned Up.This Is Very Very Bad And Irresponsible Service By Oneplus And Amazon. I'M Very Disappointed With The Service And Highly Criticize This Behavior. A Company Should Always Take Care Of Its Customer Satisfaction And You Have Failed In Doing This.What Do You Guys Expect Us To Do? Wait For 5 To 6 Days To Get My Tv Installed Even When It'S Been Delivered And Wait For You Guys To Come After So Many Days. Even When I'M Having My Smart Tv Delivered To My Home, I Have To Wait And Not Enjoy It Because You Guys Have Not Done Your Job Properly.At Least Keep Some Decency And Respect The Customers Who Are Paying A Big Amount And Ordering A Big Item From Your Company. You Should Take Care That The Money I Spent Has Been Worth It And Not Facing Any Issues. Highly Disappointed With This Behavior And Service.,Good Product,Connectivity Is Faster,But Performance Is Little Bit Slower,,The Biggest Problem I Face Is It Don'T Have A Aux Cable So I'M Not Able To Connect My Sound Bar......The Hdmi Port Is Useless It Won'T Work .So,I Connect It Via Bluetooth But The Problem Is That It Won'T Connect Automatically, Everytime I On The Tv I Need To Connect It Manually It'S A Basic Feature Which Is Not Provided In This Tv Then Another Drawback Is That It Was Fast At The Beginning Now It'S Been 4 Months And It'S Super Laggy .....Even After The Update Its Just The Same.....Yeaa But In This Price Range The Picture Quality Is Outstanding......That'S All,Good Quality In Picture And Volume Is Little Bit Low Other Than That Product Is Nice. Budget Friendly, I'M Happy With This .,After A Few Days, The Tv Will Perform Slowly And The  Remote  Is Very Very Sentence,Thank You Amazon And Oneplus,1. Sound Is Good2. Easy Installation3.

It Is A Huge Annoyance When I‚ÄôM Working At Night.2) The Cable Is Flat, Which Is Like A Double-Edged Sword. On One Hand, It Comes In Handy When Folding It On Itself And Redacting Into The Body. But When It‚ÄôS Not Hidden And Used With A Laptop, With The Adapter Being Visible, The Flat Cable Folded Sideways Looks Ugly.The Product Would‚ÄôVe Been A Perfect 5/5 If Tp Link Didn‚ÄôT Make These Strange Design Decisions.

But, I Had A Hard Budget This Time And Chose Vu Because My Friends Have Been Using It For At Least 4-5 Years Without Much Issues.While The Delivery And Installation Were Excellent, And Tv On The Whole Is A Decent Package Which Gives Good Clarity Than The Rival Chinese Tvs And Sound, Smart Features Are Poor Here.You Can Connect Bluetooth Headphones But No Option To Disconnect Them. I Had To Pair And Unpair Everytime.There Is No Voice Command Button On Remote. Even While Using The Screen Button For Voice Input, Nothing Gets Recognised. My 3K Fire Stick Voice Recognition Was Tooo Good.,I Purchased Vu Gloled 55 Inches Tv After Suggestion From My Techie Friends And Online Study. Technician From Amazon Came To My Home For Installation In Drunken Mode. But I Compromised With Him Due To Busy Schedule Of Work. He Installed Tv With His Small Screws Instead Of Vu Standard Wall Screws. He Did Whatever He Want. Proper Installation Was Not Performed.I Just Calm Down Then Later I Gave A Complaint To Amazon And Vu Customer Services. Amazon Was Not Properly Responded Till Now. But From Vu Side I Got A Huge Response Of Problem Solving. Min 3 To 4 Customercare Executives Spoke With Me, Finally Vu'S Vice President Mr Prashanth Phoned Me And Apologized Me For Inconvenience Happened To Me. He Told Drunken Technician Is Not From Vu. I Feel Good For Vu'S Top Level Executives Have Interaction With Me. From Bottom To Top Level Vus Team In Touch With Me For A Month To Resolve My Issue Due To I Stayed Away From Home.

Below Are My Observations When Using This Tv As A Secondary Tv Or Gaming Tv.Pros:1.  This Tv Comes With The Software From The Bigger Oled Tv Of Lg Meaning,  To Some Extent Better Upscaling.2.  Since I Am Using Primarily As A Gaming Tv, I Love The Game Mode.  You Can Truly See The Difference When You Play With And Without Game Mode.  Pic And Responses Are Shaper And Faster With Game Mode Active.3.  You Can Connect Bluetooth Headset To Tv.  Great When Watching Movies As A Secondary Option.4.  Lg Service Is The Best!!!  The Come Probably The Next Day,  Install The Tv (Wall Mount) For Free - Really Quick And Clean.Cons:1.  No Headphone Jack On The Tv2.  You Can Connect A Bluetooth Headphones To The Tv.  However, For Gamers,  The Game Mode Is Disabled When Tv Sound Output Is Through Headphones.  However, There Is A Work Around For This.,,It Is A Good Product From Lg In Range Of 15K.Pros:1. Bluetooth Support For My Wireless Earphone2. Audio Output Is Enough For Room Size Of 12√ó12.3. Wall Mount Installation Is Free Of Cost From Lg.4. Smart Remote In This Range Is Really Appreciable From Lg. Doubt Samsung Provide Smart Remote This In This Range.5. Picture Quality Is Decent.,,,I Love Lg Product And Happy To Buy This Product With 15.5K. It'S Very Good Smart Tv  With Amazing Features Consist Of Good Processor, Smart Remote,  Good Lcd Screen And Sound Quality Is Also Good.Recommended To Purchase.",Https://M.Media-Amazon.Com/Images/W/Webp_402378-T1/Images/I/41Wd+Zbgibl._Sy300_Sx300_.Jpg,Https://Www.Amazon.In/Lg-Inches-Ready-32Lq576Bpsa-Ceramic/Dp/B09Yl9Sn9B/Ref=Sr_1_125?Qid=1672909130&S=Electronics&Sr=1-125

For Me Personally I Tested Out At Multiple Occassion Using It For A Month Or Two I Never Got Speed Above 38 Watt And I Tested It With The Cable That I Received From The Box And It Also Gave Me The Same Speed So Buy Carefully If You'Re Conditions Are Good And You Get Speed More Tha 50Watss Then Only You Should Buy It Or You Should Go With 3A/4A Cables As They Are Cheaper And More Durable Braided Cables,The Cable Supports Fast Charging (I'M Using A Oneplus 65W Charger) As Advertised. If It Could Have Been Round And Braided Instead Of Flat Ribbon Cable, That Would Make It More Durable. In My Experience, Braided Cables Are Easy To Wrap And Store When Not In Use And They Dont Get Frayed Easily. My Cable Stopped Fast Charging After Two Months Of Usage But Warranty Support Was Excellent, I Submitted The Cable At A Nearby Centre And A New Cable Was Shipped Within 3 Days. I'Ve Been Using Boat Cables For About 6 Years Now (A Cable From A Moto G4 Phone Is Still With Me And In Use)  And Will Stick To Them.,Got The Original One, But There Are Fake Cables Being Sold, So Beware.It Warp Charges As It Supports 6A Power Supply. The Cable Is Long And Sturdy Compared To The Typical Oneplus Cable In The Box. The Price Of Original Oneplus Cable Is 890 Mrp But This I Got For 400 And Is Not Unlike Other Third Party Wires. Definitely Worth It. üëçüèª,Best In Price Segment And Durable Material Tangle Free Alsi,Amazon Send Me A Used Product But The Cable Is Super And Support Fast Charging And The Quality Is Also Good But They Sent Me A Used Product By Others If Not It'S Super Product And 3 Year'S Of Warranty On It Just Buy It,Very Good Quality Fast Charging Cable, Getting Good Quick Charging Through Laptop Also.Flat Cable Design Makes It More Durable.,I Have A Oneplus 7T With 30 Watts Charge,My Original Wire Had Been Destroyed Few Years Ago And Was Searching For A Cable With 6V-5A For Fast Charging, I Had Buyed Many Wires But The Phone Was Not Charging As Fast As 5He Original One.

Secondary, Iam A Big Fan Of Sony And Lg Brands., Thirdly,As I Have 4 Year Old Kid At Home I Was So Scared To Spend Money Beyond 15K. Ofcourse At The First Day Sale For Prime Members When The Amazon Great Indian Festival Started, I Saw One Plus And Hisense A6H Were Priced At Under 20K Including Bank Offers And My Favourite Sony 43Inch Was Priced At 35K. But Discarded Sony Just Bcz Of Expensive And Scared If My Kid Whilst Playing Will Break It. So I Was Continuously Searching For Budget Friendly Tvs Like Tcl, Redmi Nokia And Iffalcon But Didn'T Like The 32 Inch Tv. Suddenly Out Of The Blue On Thursday That Is On 20 October I Saw This Blowing Offer On Hisense Vivid 4K Tv But Scared To Buy, But I Felt Offer Was Tempting So Took The Risk And Bought It For 15,740/- ( Deal Price 20,990... Icici Bank Credit Card Instant Discount 5,250/-) So Technically Bought It For 15740/- So I Felt Worth The Risk And Bought It. On 22Nd October Tv Was Delivered To Me And Immediately I Raised Installation Request And Technician Came On 23October And Installed The Tv.That'S My Journey From Searching To Installation.Now Coming To Initial Impressions.1- Picture - I'D Say Being A Va Panel, I Can Clearly See Blacks Are Not So Deep They Are Bit Of Greyish Kind, However, Colours Are Not Over Saturated, I Felt They Are Normal And When I Looked At Tv From Sides I Can Clearly Say It Doesn'T Come Near To Ips Panel Display. But, Yeah For An Average User Like Me It'S Sufficient.2- Remote- It'S Simple, Major Apps Hotkeys Are Given. Yt, Amazon Prime Video, Hotstar Which Is Good. Voice Assistant Is Enabled. Simple And User Friendly Experience. It Lacks Hands Free Google Assistant.3- Sound- I Personally Felt If 30 Watts Audio Given In The Tv It Would Have Been Great, But Only 24Watts Given Which Is Crisp And Clear Though I Increased Volume Upto 70 To Chk, But No Distortions Nothing It'S Clear Dialogues And Bass, But If A Soundbar Is Added It Will Be Added Advantage.4- Ui- It Comes With Android 9 It Doesn'T Matter To Me As I'M A Very Average User So Runs The Show For Me, I Hope Hisense Sends The Ota Update5-Now To The Main Point As U Can See My Pictures, I See Specially In Amazon Prime Video App, On The Blue Screen There Are Some Lines Which I Don'T Know Whether It'S Problem With Panel Or Application. Need To Chk With Amazon Customer Service For The Reason. If Any User Can Help Or Enlighten Me On This Issue That Would Be Super.6- Conclusion - Frankly Speaking I Bought This Tv Only Bcz I Got It Almost Under 15000(Bought For 17520/- Including Extended Warranty For 2+2 Years) Bcz Even If Some Mishap Happens When The Kids Playing It Won'T Pinch Me . So From My Perspective I Felt It'S Okay With Some Minor Issues Like Sound. I Just Need To Get Clarity On That Prime Video Issue. If That Is Sorted I Will Be Happy.Happy Diwali To Team.,I Have Bought This Tv At 18,990.00 And At This Price Tag Its A Great Purchase.Picture Quality Is Good Not At Per With Sony Or Lg 4K Tv But Better Than Its Rivals Like Mi Redmi Vu Etc. Va Pannel Works Fine And Gives Good Amount Of Blacks.Pros:Android Tvsoundcolourcons:Remote,Loved The Picture Quality,Average Picture Quality But Ok For This Price,Worth For The Cost.

However, A Huge Relief, It Works And Works Like A Smooth Operator Using The Keys.  No Need Of Any Set Up Etc. It Doesn'T Have Voice Or Scroll Button, But I Anyways Was Not Using That Feature In My Original Magic Remote, Since That Consumes Batteries To A Great Extent Forcing You To Change Batteries Every 4 Days. Don'T Waste Money Buying Expensive Ones, Go For This.,Functionally Very Good, And It Is A Good Replacement For The Original Remote, On Which The Power Switch Had Stopped Working.

The Technician Brought A Cheap Hanging Hook That Had Mrp Inr116 On It And Asked For Inr499 For It Without Any Receipt. He Kept Telling That It Was Not For Sale And Company Had Sent This Specially. However, It Clearly Had Mrp Mentioned On It2. I Went To Market And Bought A Much Better Cabinet For Just Inr200 And For Installation Of That As Well, Technician Was Really Adamant To Drill The Two Required Holes On Top. He Just Drilled One On Top And One On Bottom And Kept All The Other Spare Screws ( Which I Had Bought ) With Him. After About Half An Hour Of Arguments, He Finally Drilled The Other Required Holes. And For All This, He Kept Cussing Me That I Wasted His Time. There Was No Assistance From The Person Who Represented The Service Agency As Well.This Whole Process Took Me Two Hours To Complete That Too With Lots Of Arguments. This Was The Worst Installation Experience In My Life So Far.Bottomline - Please Do Not Avail The 'So Called Free' Installation Service From Amazon. It Is Just A Scam. Instead Call The Acer Support. They Will Do The Job Much Better.,After Using It For 2 Months, Here Are It'S Pros And Cons:Pros :1. Great Picture Quality. It'S Awesome.2. Blacks Are Very Good And Is Adjustable.3. Sound With 30Db Is Very Good4. Looks Great With Thin Besel5. Remote Comes With Favorite Ott Buttons.6. Content Upscaling Is Very Good.Cons:1. Remote Could Have Been Better. Can'T Use Dth Remote To Turn On Both Televisison And Set Top Box.2. Remote Operation Is Bit Complex.3. Motion Technology Not Great. There Is A Noticeable Blur When Watching Moving Ballson Ott, But It Decreases When You Switch To Dth.Overall, It'S A Nice Buy At This Price Point. I Think I Am Getting Fairly Better Picture Quality And Sound. I Am Satisfied With The Product.,Product Has Good Picture Quality. Good Product At That Price With 25W Sound. Applications Running Smoothly. 3 Months Older & No Issues Yet. It'S Running Smoothly.,You Get Decent Features For The Price You Pay. Screen Resolution Might Be. Set Back As You May Find Pixalation. Overall It'S Good,I Am Amazed With The Picture Quality Of This 720P (Hd Ready) Tv. It Is Truly An Amazing Panel. I Found It Suitable For A Viewing Distance Of Between 6 To 10 Feet. Any Nearer It May Not Look Very Crisp And Any Farther, It Will Feel Like A Very Small Size. The Speakers Are Also Very Good For The Price And Can Get Very Loud Without Any Distortions. However, Since The Speaker Is Downward Firing, The Experience Will Vary Based On Whether The Tv Is Wall Mounted Or Kept On A Stand.The Remote Is Good, Voice Search Works Well For Me. Tv Start Up Takes A Long Time In My Opinion, But I Have Not Compared It Against Any Other 32 Inch Tv And Hence Do Not Know Where It Stands Among Peers.5 Ghz Wifi Works Very Well Even Across Walls. Only Negative Aspect I Faced Is W.R.T The Experience Of Using My Bluetooth Headphones/Earphones. Firstly, The Connection Sometimes Doesn'T Happen Automatically After A  Restart - Which Means I Have To Remove And Re-Discover The Device Thru The Menu Which Is Not Simple. Secondly, The Signal Itself Seems To Be Very Weak And Even At A Distance Of 8 Feet In Front Of The Tv, The Signal Breaks Even If You Move Your Head By 2-3 Inches.However, I Am Still Super Happy With This Tv. I Got It For 8K During The Launch Offer And It Is Totally Worth It And Is Recommended From My Side.,At This Price Range(‚Çπ11499/-)It Is Good Quality Product On This Market..Acer Only Should Work With Sound Quality Improvement Otherwise All Ok.Picture Quality Really Impressive,Wifi Connectivity Good,Easy To Install,Boderless Screen Design Is Premium And Also Google Voice Support Is Good(Sometimes Lagging).No Major Issues Found On This Tv.Just Go For It.,Vellu For Money.

The Picture Quality Is Good And The Streaming Capabilities Are Convenient. The User Interface Is Easy To Navigate, Although It Did Take Me A Little Bit Of Time To Get Used To It.However, I Do Have A Few Issues With The Tv. The Sound Quality Is Not The Best And I Have Noticed Some Lag When Switching Between Apps. These Issues Do Not Significantly Impact My Viewing Experience, But They Are Worth Mentioning.Despite These Issues, I Would Still Give The Kodak Tv 3 Stars Out Of 5. It Is A Decent Tv For The Price, But There Are Certainly Better Options Out There. I Was Offered An Additional 3 Months Of Warranty If I Wrote A Review, But I Am Not Particularly Interested In Extending The Warranty At This Time.It Is Not Appropriate Or Ethical To Write A False Or Misleading Review In Exchange For Incentives, Such As An Extended Warranty Or Other Perks. Doing So Goes Against Amazon'S Guidelines And Can Lead To Consequences For Both The Customer And The Company.It Is Important To Be Honest And Transparent In Your Reviews And To Only Write About Your Genuine Experiences With A Product. This Helps Other Customers Make Informed Decisions About Their Purchases And Ensures That The Review System Remains Fair And Trustworthy.If You Are Not Satisfied With The Kodak Tv Or Do Not Feel Comfortable Giving It A High Rating, It Is Perfectly Okay To Give It A Lower Rating Or To Not Write A Review At All. It Is Always Better To Be Honest And Genuine In Your Reviews, Rather Than Attempting To Manipulate The System For Personal Gain.,Issues With Chrome Casting,I Did Not Believe Such A Good Feature Would Be Available At This Price.  I Liked The Feature Of Supporting The Ethernet Port And Earphone Jack.,Kodak Tv,For The Amount Being Charged, This Is A Acceptable Tv.The Kodak 7Xpro  Model Is Same As Thomson 9A Series.Despite Being 32"" Big, This Was Lighter Than My Previous Bravia 18"" Tv And Easily Mounted To The Previous Wall-Mount. Note: The Wall Mount Holes Are Plasticky And Dont Have Any Metal Insert.The Remote Sensor Is Separate Module Projecting From The Underside Of The Tv And Does Not Look Integrated  With The Main Body.The Two Usb Ports Are Side By Side Which Dont Interfere With Each Other.The Audio Out Port Is A Good Feature If One Wants To Watch Tv Without Disturbing Others.When I First Connected The Tv To My Set-Top Box Over Hdmi, There Was Only Picture And No Sound.The Person At The Service Center Whose Number Is Listed On The Tv'S Warranty Card Said That They Dont Support This And I Need To Call The Tv Manufacturer. So Much For Printing A Service Center Number On Warranty Card.This Was Fixed After Changing The Hdmi Cec Settings In The Set-Top Box (Not Tv'S Fault).There Is No User-Manual Given With The Tv. Most People, Based On Their Experience With Phone Should Be Able To Ultimately Figure Out The Connections. The Only Included Leaflet-Book (Whose Pages Were All Stuck Together) Talks About The Android Menu, There Is No Info On The Tv'S Input Jacks (Like What The Hdmi Arc Stands For).I Got Multiple Calls After The Purchase To Enquire About Delivery And If I Needed Installation.As I Already Had A Previous Wall Mount On Which This Could Get Attached With No Hassles, I Opted Out Of Installation Service.,All Is Welllll,Good Tv,Picture Quality Is Very Good",Https://M.Media-Amazon.Com/Images/I/41Zptrpwcpl._Sy300_Sx300_Ql70_Fmwebp_.Jpg,Https://Www.Amazon.In/Kodak-Inches-Certified-Android-32Hdx7Xpro/Dp/B08Cs3Bt4L/Ref=Sr_1_163?Qid=1672909131&S=Electronics&Sr=1-163

Best Focus Can Be Get, When Projecting Exactly Oppsite To The Projector Probably 5 To 6 Inch Above, So If We Flip The Projector Upside Down, We Get Best Focus Opposite To Center A Few Inches Down.For Mysetup, Where Projecting Only 1.5 Feet Above From The Floor, Going To Use A Wall Mount To Setup The Projector Upside Down, This Way I Can Fix The Projector A Bit More Above/Behind The Sofa. I Will Post The Pics Later, Once It Is Setup Properly.Now The Verdict - This Projector With A Combination Of Reflective Projector Screen( Look It Up On Amazon Xelectron Or Minago Brand) Is One Of Most Vfm Combo For Approx 11K For Experiencing A Very Bright 100 Inch Screen Experience Of Good Quality For 1 Or 2 Person.  But Now That Im Considering Buying One Of Those Expensive Fixed Frame Alr Projector Screens Costing Upward Of 15K To 30K, Im Thinikg It Would Have Been Better If I Could Have Invested A Bit More On A Brighter Projector(Look Only Ansi Value). This Buy Was More Of An Impulse Purchase, But It Is More Then Good Enough For Me Now To Make Me Consider Much Costlier Projector Screens And Then Later Upgrade To A High End Projector.Edit: The Biggest Drawback Of This Projector Is That Dust Gets Inside On Lcd Panel, Which Impacts The Clarity Also After A Few Days. I Had To Clean The Panel Myselg Just After 1.5 Month.  New Lesson Learnt, Apart From High Ansi Lumen Projector, This Is Also An Important Factor For Future Purchase. Planning To Get A Custom Cloth Cover Made, So That I Dont Have To Clean It Often. Though, Lcd Cleaning Can Be Done Pretty Easily Without Much Opening And Its Easier Compared To Youtube Videos I Have Seen For Previous Model. Somehow Lens Did Not Get Any Dust Inside Yet. Only The Lcd Has Very Very Fine Dust Particles Inside.,Quality Is Good, Value For Money. Bluetooth Connectivity Is Smooth And Fast. The Sound Quality Of The Projector Is Not So Great But That We Had Already Considered Before. Hotstar App Really Works Nicely With Great Quality, And So Does Youtube. Netflix & Prime Video Doesn'T Give The Same Quality Initially, But That Must Be Wifi Connection. Some Apps However Don'T Get Installed, Or Just Close On Their Own.The Good Point Is The Bluetooth Connection, And Even We Have Added A Bluetooth Soundbar, So Moving It And Putting It In Any Room Has Become A Really Good Option.,This Is Indeed A Fantastic Product In This Price Range.It Is Non Android So You Need To Add An Amazon Fire Stick Or Some Other Source Device Through Hdmineedless To Say The Brightness Is Pretty Good For Dark Environments And Is Also Watchable During Day I.E. If You Can Cover Up Your Windows And Other Light Sources.Screen Spread Is Almost Up To 120 Inch At A Throw Distance Of 13 To 1 Feet With The Sharpness More Or Less Intact.Converts 4K To 1080Pwill Recommend A Tripod Mount Or A Custom Made Mount Like Mine.Ensure That The Walls Are White For Best Image / Video Reproduction.Definitely Recommended At This Price Point.Consonly Vertical Keystone Correction Available,Projector Is Good So Far As It Used For Last 3 Days. May Revisit The Feedback After A Couple Of Months.,I Bought This Projector For My Classroom And It‚ÄôS Very Helpful For Their Studies. Now Students Connect Themselves More To The World.üòä,I Feel It'S A Value For Money Product As I Have Already Used It For Last Two Months.,If U R Looking For A Home Entertainer Projector Look No Further..... This Is It...!!! Best In Price, Good Picture Quality, Brightness And A Decent Remote With Good Functionality... As Always Premium Buyers Avoid As These R For Normal Home With Normal Needs... Very Good For Family Get Together, Movie Nights And Kids Will Be Awe Struck At Its Enormity... I'Ve Canceled My Dth Connection Coz Amazon Prime Tv Stick With This Projector Is All I Need... That'S All The Time I Have For Watching Tv Amidst My Work And They Do The Job Well... An Entertaining Night After A Busy Day N You Will Be Done Satisfied... Any Queries Ping Me I'Ll Help U As Much As I Can... Don'T Worry Abt Specs And Other Details Takeit From A Family Man,It Will Satisfy All Ur Needs,Be It Surfing, Movies Or Gaming And With Fire Tv Stick Mirroring Is Possible Too... Hope It Helps...Update After 4 Months - 4Hrs/Day Usage :The Pic Uploaded Was By Noon 1Pm With Dark Screens...Hi, This Was A Reply To A Customer To Help Choose Between Egate I9 N Uc 68 & 46,  But I Thought If This Was Put Up In Update Section A Lot Would Benefit So Here It Goes...First U Need To Be Clear On Ur Purpose For This Projector Like If It'S For Offic Use Or Home Entertainment, Also U Didn'T Mention Its Source Like Dth Or Fire Tv Stick Etc... Since U Have Not I'Ll Go With A General Review For Purposes... It'S Going To Be A Very Detailed Review So Guys With Out Patience Can Run To The End At Once...!!!I Too Had A Similar Confusion Based On Competition For Egate I9 From Uc 68 & 46... Let Me Tell U What Helped Me Decide...First N Foremost Egate Is An Indian Company Unlike Uc Which Is A Common Chinese Product With A Namesake Brand Uc (Confirmed It With My Friend In China)... Hence Service N General Trust Is More On Egate Than Competition...Secondly, From Fellow Customers, I'Ve Learnt That Egate Is Brighter Than The Rest Two...Thirdly, The Images Are Sharp And There'S No Blur On Text On Egate Compared To The Other Two... Just Learn To Adjust The Keystone Properly...Fourth, The Length Of The Power Cord Is Longer In Egate...Fifth, It'S Got A Lens Cover To Close The Lens When Not In Use... The Others Don'T Have It...Now In General I'Ve Not Used The Other Two But The Input Of Data For The Other Two Are From Their Users, So I'M Gonna Tell U Wat I'Ve Done N Wat Else U Can Do With Egate...I'Ve Placed It At A Length Of 15 Feet From The Screen N It Gives Awesome Display... Connect A 2.1 /5.1 Home Speaker System If U R Trying For Home Theatre Effect But The Inbuilt Speaker Is Good Enuf At 2/3 Feet Projection From The End Of Ur Bed With Kids Sleeping Around...I'Ve Connected My Second Fire Tv Stick, With It So It Connects To Wi-Fi For Movies N Serials N Mirroring Is Done By It For Playing From Mobiles N Game Too Like Cod N Pubg N Ff... Also U Have Connectivity For Laptop N Pendrive Etc...U Get A Remote Which Functions Well Along With It...Most Importantly, U Can Ceiling Mount It Or Tripod It Too Which The Other Two Cant... But Remember If U R Ceiling Mounting It U Need To Flip The Display By 180¬∞ In The Settings Coz U Would Mountbit Upside Down As The Option Is Provided Under The Projector But For Tripod It'S Not Necessary...Also U Can Place The Projector Behind The Screen Like An Actual Theatre If U R Using A Cloth Screen Like Me N Constraint Of Space, But Remember To Flip The Image From Right To Left In Settings As The Projector Is Behind The Screen N U Need To Get A 90¬∞ Flipped Image From Behind...So I Guess It'S The 3D Part That Made Ur Decision Murky, Wat I Would Love To Say For That Is I'Ve A Samsung 3D Enabled Smart Tv N I'Ve Seen The Output Of These Kind Of Cheap 3D Devices Too, Since Its A Low Cost Projector 3D Effects Are Going To Give U A Headache Coz Of Pixelation Better To Opt For A Tv If 3D Is A Priority, As In Tv The 3D Effects R Awesome... But Nowadays U Can Install An App In Any Device To Watch 3D Movies Or Better Download A 3D Movie In Pendrive N Play It N Watch It With Ur 3D Glasses... My Friends Do It But I Don'T...Verdict : ""Best Projector In Market In My Opinion For The Price And Home Entertainment Purpose""Note : For Amazon Prime N Netflix Users, If U R Using A 2.1 Audio Output Sometimes U Might Not Get Audio So Dont Get Worried N Its Nothing Wrong With The Projector Its Just That The Latest Movies Are Made With Dolby 5.1 Sound So Just Use The On Screen Setting In The Video To Navigate To Sound N Choose Stereo From The Default Dolby Option & Voila U R Done...!!!Hope It Helps, Ping Me For Any Doubts...Hit Like, If My Review Was Useful...!!!,As Per Money It'S Bestbut If You Are Fan Of Pictures Qualitythink About Budget",Https://M.Media-Amazon.Com/Images/W/Webp_402378-T1/Images/I/51Dhrntyo0L._Sx300_Sy300_Ql70_Fmwebp_.Jpg,Https://Www.Amazon.In/Support-Display-Projector-Connectivity-E03I31/Dp/B088Z1Ywbc/Ref=Sr_1_176?Qid=1672909133&S=Electronics&Sr=1-176

Best Suited For Motorcycle Mobile Mounts And Powerbanks.[Price Bought At: ‚Çπ309]_______________________________________________________________________________________Long Review:I Used To Wrap Long Charging Cables Around The Handle Bar So That It Won'T Come In The Way While Turning. After Being Fed Up Of Wrapping Cables To Handlebars, I Wanted Something Short Just To Sit There And Charge Device And Clear The Clutter On Motorcycle Handle. This Is Just What I Wanted.I Have A Mobile Mount That Looks Like Bobo Gears Jaw Grip Mount From Local Stores And That Delivers 5V ~2.4A. Tried Few Cables From Local Stores And They Either Die Or Doesn'T Charge The Device Enough When It Is In Use. Even When The Device Is Not In Use, The Charging Rate Used To Be Low.That Is When I Have Decided To Give This One A Try As I Was Always Hesitant That ‚Çπ300+ For A Short Cable Is Too High. Now I Am Pretty Happy With The Purchase That It Can Fetch The Complete Charging Capacity Of The Mobile Charger And Deliver It To The Device. I Did A 400Kms Roundtrip And This Has Been A Saviour.

I Will Update When I Get A Chance To Test That.Coming To The Design And Quality, The Braided Cable Looks Rugged And The Metal Connectors Feel Solid. As I Am Going To Use It Only On The Motorcycle, I Am Sure I Will Put It Through Some Abuse And I Can Comment On The Same When I Revisit This Review For Updates.Durability:I Will Have To Use It More And Update This Review On The Durability Perspective, As My First Wayona Dash Charge Cable I Used For Oneplus 6 Died In 3 Months.

The Technician Brought A Cheap Hanging Hook That Had Mrp Inr116 On It And Asked For Inr499 For It Without Any Receipt. He Kept Telling That It Was Not For Sale And Company Had Sent This Specially. However, It Clearly Had Mrp Mentioned On It2. I Went To Market And Bought A Much Better Cabinet For Just Inr200 And For Installation Of That As Well, Technician Was Really Adamant To Drill The Two Required Holes On Top. He Just Drilled One On Top And One On Bottom And Kept All The Other Spare Screws ( Which I Had Bought ) With Him. After About Half An Hour Of Arguments, He Finally Drilled The Other Required Holes. And For All This, He Kept Cussing Me That I Wasted His Time. There Was No Assistance From The Person Who Represented The Service Agency As Well.This Whole Process Took Me Two Hours To Complete That Too With Lots Of Arguments. This Was The Worst Installation Experience In My Life So Far.Bottomline - Please Do Not Avail The 'So Called Free' Installation Service From Amazon. It Is Just A Scam. Instead Call The Acer Support. They Will Do The Job Much Better.,After Using It For 2 Months, Here Are It'S Pros And Cons:Pros :1. Great Picture Quality. It'S Awesome.2. Blacks Are Very Good And Is Adjustable.3. Sound With 30Db Is Very Good4. Looks Great With Thin Besel5. Remote Comes With Favorite Ott Buttons.6. Content Upscaling Is Very Good.Cons:1. Remote Could Have Been Better. Can'T Use Dth Remote To Turn On Both Televisison And Set Top Box.2. Remote Operation Is Bit Complex.3. Motion Technology Not Great. There Is A Noticeable Blur When Watching Moving Ballson Ott, But It Decreases When You Switch To Dth.Overall, It'S A Nice Buy At This Price Point. I Think I Am Getting Fairly Better Picture Quality And Sound. I Am Satisfied With The Product.,Product Has Good Picture Quality. Good Product At That Price With 25W Sound. Applications Running Smoothly. 3 Months Older & No Issues Yet. It'S Running Smoothly.,You Get Decent Features For The Price You Pay. Screen Resolution Might Be. Set Back As You May Find Pixalation. Overall It'S Good,I Am Amazed With The Picture Quality Of This 720P (Hd Ready) Tv. It Is Truly An Amazing Panel. I Found It Suitable For A Viewing Distance Of Between 6 To 10 Feet. Any Nearer It May Not Look Very Crisp And Any Farther, It Will Feel Like A Very Small Size. The Speakers Are Also Very Good For The Price And Can Get Very Loud Without Any Distortions. However, Since The Speaker Is Downward Firing, The Experience Will Vary Based On Whether The Tv Is Wall Mounted Or Kept On A Stand.The Remote Is Good, Voice Search Works Well For Me. Tv Start Up Takes A Long Time In My Opinion, But I Have Not Compared It Against Any Other 32 Inch Tv And Hence Do Not Know Where It Stands Among Peers.5 Ghz Wifi Works Very Well Even Across Walls. Only Negative Aspect I Faced Is W.R.T The Experience Of Using My Bluetooth Headphones/Earphones. Firstly, The Connection Sometimes Doesn'T Happen Automatically After A  Restart - Which Means I Have To Remove And Re-Discover The Device Thru The Menu Which Is Not Simple. Secondly, The Signal Itself Seems To Be Very Weak And Even At A Distance Of 8 Feet In Front Of The Tv, The Signal Breaks Even If You Move Your Head By 2-3 Inches.However, I Am Still Super Happy With This Tv. I Got It For 8K During The Launch Offer And It Is Totally Worth It And Is Recommended From My Side.,At This Price Range(‚Çπ11499/-)It Is Good Quality Product On This Market..Acer Only Should Work With Sound Quality Improvement Otherwise All Ok.Picture Quality Really Impressive,Wifi Connectivity Good,Easy To Install,Boderless Screen Design Is Premium And Also Google Voice Support Is Good(Sometimes Lagging).No Major Issues Found On This Tv.Just Go For It.,Vellu For Money.

Picture Quality And Sound Quality Is Good.I Added Firestick To It And It Voila Became Smart Tv. The Connections To Attach These Usbs Are At The Bottom Part Of The Tv Which Is Slightly Different From Other Tvs.So Far, Working As It Should.Revising This After 9 Days, The Tv Is Not Responding To Switch Off Button. This Is Happening More When I Watch The Tv For A Few Hours And Then When I Switch Off The Tv With The Firestick Remote, The Yellow Colour Indicator Down Below Does Not Turn Red, Instead It Remains Yellow. As Far As Screen Is Concerned, The Tv'S Screen Changes To Black Whitish, Seems To Me That The Tv Goes Into Hibernation Or Sleep Mode. This Is A Fault Of The Tv As A Normal Tv Should Swith Off Completely And The Indicator Should Turn Red. I Have Called Technician Tomorrow And If He Checks And If He Agrees, Then I Should Get A Replacement As I Got Still 2 Days Time To Replace It.Just A Helping Note For People Buying This Tv: If You Are Going To Connect Firestick To It, As It Asks For The Brand Name Of The Tv, You Can Select Vu And It Will Perfectly Work On Your Firestick.

Samsung Is Always Good,Value For Money Product","Before Finalizing The Aue60 55"", I Visited Croma And Vijay Sales To Check For The Same Tv Or Similar Models For Their Features And Picture Quality. I Was Told Aue60 & Aue70(The Models Listed Here As Crystal 4K And 4K Pro) Are E-Commerce Exclusive Models, Not Available Offline. I Was Shown Au7700 Which Has The Same Processor, Panel And Features, But Was Listed At 65K For The 55"" Version. I Liked The Picture Quality, And Decided I'Ll Get The Aue60 Since It Shares So Much With Au7700, And Save ~20K.Why I Went For Aue60  Vs. Aue70 - I Knew I Wouldn'T Be Needing A Voice Assistant, And Wanted To Save 3K. I Knew Even If I Wanted A Voice Assistant, I Could Plug In Fire Tv/Mi Tv Box And Get Those Features Later On. Delivery Was Pretty Hassle Free, The Delivery Executive Unloaded The Tv In The Room I Asked For, And Opened The Box To Inspect The Tv For Any Physical Damages. Samsung Technicians Came In A Few Hours Later, Installed And Gave A Demo.Sound:Per Other Reviews - Sound From Speakers Is Apparently Bad, But In My Case, I Found It Satisfactory. I Have It Wall Mounted In A 10X12Ft Room, And The Tv'S Speakers Sound Better Compared To Bose Soundlink Speakers That I Connected It To Via Bluetooth.Picture:The Panel'S Great, But Nothing Worth Raving About. Gray Uniformity Isn'T Great(I.E. Gray Tones Won'T Be Perfectly Uniform Across The Whole Panel, There'Ll Be Darker Zones Towards The Edges/Corners Based On Backlight Placement). Blacks Aren'T Perfectly Black - And They'Re Brighter Than You'D Expect From A Va Panel, But This Isn'T Noticeable At All When The Room Is Lit. No Backlight Bleed. Colors Are As Good As I'D Like Them To Be, And The Panel Does Get Noticeably Bright For My Taste, Even When Brightness Is Turned Down To 40%. 720P Content Is Watchable From >8Ft, 1080P Is Good(I'D Say Better Than I Expected), And 4K Is Well, 4K.Connectivity:I Have A 35 Mb/S Broadband  Connection And All Content Streams In 4K When Available, Without Stutters. The Tv Has Bluetooth 5.0, And Works With Tws And Neckband Earphones Fine(I Use Oppo Enco W51 And Boat Rockerz 330) - There'S No Noticeable Latency, And Volume Can Be Controlled Through The Remote Itself.Apps & Features:Has All The Standard Slew Of Streaming Apps I Needed - Netflix, Hotstar, Prime, Apple Tv+ & Youtube. All Of Them Stream 4K Content, Except For Hotstar - Which Only Streamed 4K A Few Times. 1080P Is Still Very Watchable, And Not Really A Deal Breaker. No Dolby Vision Support - Which I Made My Peace With Considering The Fact That 99% Of Budget Tvs In The Market Can'T Produce The Contrast You'D Expect Out Of Dv Content Anyways, So Why Care. You Get Hdr, And Hdr Content Is Definitely Better Looking Than Non-Hdr Ones In Terms Of Colors And Vibrancy. I Planned To Use The Tv Without Cable, But The Tv Does Come With Some Channels Like Republic Tv, Bloomberg, 9Xm, Etc., These Stream In 1080P, So A Great Bonus To Have.Remote:Very Basic Rf Remote, Unlike Bluetooth Ones On Most New Tvs. The Remote'S Looks Pretty Sleek And Stylish, But That'S About It. Biggest Gripe - Typing To Search For Things Within Apps Is A Pain In The Behind, You'Ll Need To Use The D-Pad To Navigate On An On-Screen Keyboard. You Can Control The Tv Using Samsung'S Smartthings App, But Guess What - You Can'T Even Use Your Phone'S Keyboard To Type In When Controlling Through The App - This Is Something That Can Be Added Through An Update, But It'S Not There Yet.Attached Pictures Are All Of 4K Content. Resolution Might Get Scaled Down After I Submit The Review, But You Can Still Get An Idea Of The Tv'S Design/Looks, Panel Colors And Contrast, Etc.I'D Say I'M Really Happy - And Given The Chance, Wouldn'T Change My Decision. It'S A Samsung Tv, So End Of The Day, If It Produces A Decent Picture, And Lasts A Couple Of Years More Than I Expect, I Can Overlook All Other Cons. I'D Highly Recommend The Tv If You Have The Same Expectations From Your Next Tv.,,Placed Order On 18Th Dec'22 Received Defective Product, Updated To Amazon Service They Replaced With New Product Today(27/12/22).Will Post Long Term Review.Pros: Picture Quality, Design (Thin N Bezel Less)Cons: Sound (Bit Okay),Upsacling Of Sd Channelsover All Satisfied.,Have Been Using It Since Month Now.-Picture Quality Is Amazing. 4.5/5-As Always Installation Service From Samsung Was Seemless. 5/5-Smart Features Are Good This Model Don'T Have Voice Recognition.

Thanks Amazon,A Good Product In A Higher Price Side,Average Ok Ok Quality,Fit Can Be Better As Side Portions Are Loose And Might Reduce Overall Cover'S Life As Kids Put Finger And Small Items Into It. However The Top And Lower Portions Are Tight Enough To Meet The Purpose.

The Tv Is Still Going Strong - All The Good Points Mentioned In The Original Review Below Are Still True And Very Happy With The Tv.It'S As If Oneplus Have Been Listening To Their Customers! After Recent Firmware Updates, The Issues I Had Mentioned Have Almost Disappeared.1. We Can Now Arrange And Move Apps (Youtube, Netflix) As Per Our Wish On The Home Screen Itself. I Am Finally Able To Put Youtube First As It Is The Most Used App For My Toddler.2. There Is No More Wifi Disconnect Issue Noted Earlier.3. Prime Video Still Shows Errors Sometimes. Though I Think That'S An Issue With The App And Not The Tv.Strongly Recommend This Tv!Original Review:I Took A Leap Of Faith In Purchasing This Tv As There Were Mixed Reviews For It. However, After Using It For 2 Months, The Following Are My Observations:Good:1. The Picture Quality Is Fantastic. There Is No Lag While Watching/Forwarding 4K/8K Videos.2. I Saw A Youtube Review Which Said Its Brightness Was Low Compared To Other Models - The Brightness Is More Than You Would Ever Need From A Tv. I Have Never Needed To Run It On Full Brightness Till Now, Up To 40 Works For Me. For My Toddler To Watch Rhymes, I Set Brightness To 0, And Even Then It Is More Than Needed.3. There Were A Few Reviews That Said The Sound Quality Was Average And You Need A Soundbar. I Disagree - I Have Watched Movies With Up To 50 Sound And That Is Good Enough For A 1000 Sqft Hall.4. Voice Command - It Is Quite Accurate And I Am Able To Change Nursery Rhymes For My Toddler While Working In The Kitchen Which Is Around 15 - 20 Feet Away.5. Being Able To Control The Tv From App Is Also A Very Useful Feature - No Need To Look For Remote. Being Able To Cast From The App Also Helps A Lot. It Would Be Even Better If Everything On Phone (Not Just Pictures And Videos) Could Be Cast Using The Appnot So Good:1. If The Tv Goes To Sleep/Screensaver For More Than 10 Minutes,A. It Often Gets Disconnected From Wifi - Have To Restart It Againb. Prime Video Fails To Resume - Displays Error - And Have To Restart The Tv Againc. On The Home Screen, You Cannot Rearrange Apps To Have Your Preferred Apps First. You Can Do It In Apps Window Which Is Useless As You Need To Navigate To It First - Easier To Navigate To Your Preferred App In The Home Screen Itself.,Only Cons Till Now Got, Fast Moving Object Looks Blurr, Which Was Known Before Buying By Other User Review, But I Got This Tv In 32 K,Ao Over All Satishfied,Only Minus That Too Critical Is The Installation Service Provider.The Product Is To Installed By V Care Installation Services Provider.The Installation Service Provider Is A Total Waste And Not Responded Properly.Actual Date Of Installation Was On 21.02.22 But Was Only Done By The Service Provider On 27.10.22.The Executive Who Attended The Installation Is A Total Waste Person And Don'T Know How To Behave To The Customer.He Behaved Very Rudely.The Installation Service Provider Is A Total Damage And Waste.

No Need To Do Any Voodoo With Pulling Cables, Powering Off This And That, To Make Dp Cable Work, Just Works Straight Out Of The Box.Strangely, This Cable Didn'T Support My Logitech G603 (Wireless Gaming Mouse) Lightspeed Connection. The Dongle Is Attached To The 1St Of The Two Dell 2520D Monitors. Mouse Works When I Am Viewing Over Type-C Pd Display With My Laptops. Otherwise Audio, Video, Resolution , Refresh Rates Didn'T Bother.Durability Could Be A Question, Let'S Wait And Observe Over The Days. A Lot Have Commented That This Cable Didn'T Last Long.,Best In The Budget.,This Is Not Vesa Certified Cable. Sometimes The Monitor  Goes Black For 3 To 4 Second.,,The Product Is Good, Its Been Almost A Week I Am Using This Cable. I Am Using A Lg 24Gm77 Monitor (1080P 144Hz) As Soon As I Installed This Cable The Display Went On Default Refresh Rate (60 Hz). Then I Went Into Windows Display Settings (As Nvidia Settings Didn'T Have Refresh Rate More Than 60 Hz) To Change The Refresh Rate To 144 Hz And It Switched Without Any Issues. Avoid Jerks To The Monitor As I Figured The Display Goes Off For A Brief 1 Or 2 Secs Post Jerking. Rest The Cable Quality Is Good, However Locks To The Display Ports Could Be Appreciated. Rest All Is Fine. I Hope This Review Might Be Helpful.

Thicker The Cladding, Better The Audio Quality, This Cable Only Got A Thin Cladding Of Copper The Steel/Aluminium Reinforced Center Is For A More Durable Conductor. Now No Where In The Description Amazon Has Mentioned That This Is A Pure Copper Cladding Cable, So Just Need To Get Your Expectations Right.

This Is Just What I Wanted.I Have A Mobile Mount That Looks Like Bobo Gears Jaw Grip Mount From Local Stores And That Delivers 5V ~2.4A. Tried Few Cables From Local Stores And They Either Die Or Doesn'T Charge The Device Enough When It Is In Use. Even When The Device Is Not In Use, The Charging Rate Used To Be Low.That Is When I Have Decided To Give This One A Try As I Was Always Hesitant That ‚Çπ300+ For A Short Cable Is Too High.

I Will Update When I Get A Chance To Test That.Coming To The Design And Quality, The Braided Cable Looks Rugged And The Metal Connectors Feel Solid.

The Technician Brought A Cheap Hanging Hook That Had Mrp Inr116 On It And Asked For Inr499 For It Without Any Receipt. He Kept Telling That It Was Not For Sale And Company Had Sent This Specially. However, It Clearly Had Mrp Mentioned On It2. I Went To Market And Bought A Much Better Cabinet For Just Inr200 And For Installation Of That As Well, Technician Was Really Adamant To Drill The Two Required Holes On Top. He Just Drilled One On Top And One On Bottom And Kept All The Other Spare Screws ( Which I Had Bought ) With Him. After About Half An Hour Of Arguments, He Finally Drilled The Other Required Holes. And For All This, He Kept Cussing Me That I Wasted His Time. There Was No Assistance From The Person Who Represented The Service Agency As Well.This Whole Process Took Me Two Hours To Complete That Too With Lots Of Arguments. This Was The Worst Installation Experience In My Life So Far.Bottomline - Please Do Not Avail The 'So Called Free' Installation Service From Amazon. It Is Just A Scam. Instead Call The Acer Support. They Will Do The Job Much Better.,After Using It For 2 Months, Here Are It'S Pros And Cons:Pros :1. Great Picture Quality. It'S Awesome.2. Blacks Are Very Good And Is Adjustable.3. Sound With 30Db Is Very Good4. Looks Great With Thin Besel5. Remote Comes With Favorite Ott Buttons.6. Content Upscaling Is Very Good.Cons:1. Remote Could Have Been Better. Can'T Use Dth Remote To Turn On Both Televisison And Set Top Box.2. Remote Operation Is Bit Complex.3. Motion Technology Not Great. There Is A Noticeable Blur When Watching Moving Ballson Ott, But It Decreases When You Switch To Dth.Overall, It'S A Nice Buy At This Price Point. I Think I Am Getting Fairly Better Picture Quality And Sound. I Am Satisfied With The Product.,Product Has Good Picture Quality. Good Product At That Price With 25W Sound. Applications Running Smoothly. 3 Months Older & No Issues Yet. It'S Running Smoothly.,You Get Decent Features For The Price You Pay. Screen Resolution Might Be. Set Back As You May Find Pixalation. Overall It'S Good,I Am Amazed With The Picture Quality Of This 720P (Hd Ready) Tv. It Is Truly An Amazing Panel. I Found It Suitable For A Viewing Distance Of Between 6 To 10 Feet. Any Nearer It May Not Look Very Crisp And Any Farther, It Will Feel Like A Very Small Size. The Speakers Are Also Very Good For The Price And Can Get Very Loud Without Any Distortions. However, Since The Speaker Is Downward Firing, The Experience Will Vary Based On Whether The Tv Is Wall Mounted Or Kept On A Stand.The Remote Is Good, Voice Search Works Well For Me. Tv Start Up Takes A Long Time In My Opinion, But I Have Not Compared It Against Any Other 32 Inch Tv And Hence Do Not Know Where It Stands Among Peers.5 Ghz Wifi Works Very Well Even Across Walls. Only Negative Aspect I Faced Is W.R.T The Experience Of Using My Bluetooth Headphones/Earphones. Firstly, The Connection Sometimes Doesn'T Happen Automatically After A  Restart - Which Means I Have To Remove And Re-Discover The Device Thru The Menu Which Is Not Simple. Secondly, The Signal Itself Seems To Be Very Weak And Even At A Distance Of 8 Feet In Front Of The Tv, The Signal Breaks Even If You Move Your Head By 2-3 Inches.However, I Am Still Super Happy With This Tv.

Working Good. But Sound Volume & Clarity Not Adequate. Durability, To Be Assessed.  Dear Amazon.In, Tell The Seller To Write Connecting Procedure Clearly.Manual Printing Also Is Bad. I Had To Struggle.,Does What It Says. Works Well To Connect Two Bluetooth Devices To Any Other Device Like A Laptop, Smart Tv, Etc. Can Take A Bit Of Time To Pair Two Devices. But The Manual In The Box Helps.Sound Quality Over Aux Cable Too Is Good. So, Even If You Do Not Have A Digital Output Or Rca You Can Still Use It. Bit Bit Flimsy And Delicate. But Then You Don'T Need To Move It Around Everyday.,Disadvantage - The Sound And Video Lag With Distance While Connecting Bluetooth With Headphones.Pairing With Headphones Difficult (Need To Wait Long)Feels Volumes Low.,,I Got This To Add-On To A High-End System, Which Traditionally Doesn'T Have The Facility. However It'S Often Requested When Guests Come Over. I Was Using A Phoenix Transreceiver, But The Constant Need Of Charging And The Single Indicator Led Made It Difficult To Integrate Into This Kind Of Application. The Optical Out Is Connected To A Dual Ess9028 Dac, And The Device Used For Transmission Is The Ipad Air.This Lacks A Battery, Which Is A Big Differentiator. This Means It Is Not Exactly Portable, And The Form Factor Reinforces That 'Feature'. It Is Intended To Be A Desktop Unit, And It Comes With A Reasonable Set Of Cables. The Quality Of The Included Cables Is Quite Poor, So It'S Best To Use Something Else.Compared To The Direct Input From Usb, The Overall Sound Is Poorer, With A Shrunken Soundstage And Coarse Vocals And Treble. Still, This Is Being Used In A High-End System - I Suspect With Many Lesser Speaker/Amp/Dacs It Will Be Acceptable. At Maximum Output, The Level Is About 1-2Db Lower Than A Direct Usb Connection To The Dac.It Is Around The Same As My Signature Acoustics Unit, Which Is 1/3Rd The Size But Uses A Battery, And Doesn'T Have A Volume Control Or The Bypass Feature, Or The Nice Display Which Is Handy If You Are Close By.The Bypass Is One Of The Highlights Of This Device, It Basically Connects The Two Optical Ports Together In Passthrough, And Allows You To Use Both Bt And Another Optical Source/Receiver - Though Only Either Can Be Used At A Time.The Build Quality Is Average. It Is Lightweight Enough That A Set Of Decent Cables Will Tip It Over Backwards, Hence The Thin Cables Supplied. The Onboard Volume Control Is Nice, If A Bit Redundant Given Everybody Uses Their Handheld Or Other Device To Control Volume (I Use The Dac Remote). It Also Has Only 16 Clicks, So The Control Will Be Very Coarse. The Display Has No Spelling Errors And While The Resolution Is Low, It Is Sufficient For The Tasks.Overall, It'S Quite Expensive But Is More Kitted Out Than Similar Devices. The Sound Quality Limitations Of Bt Transmission (Compulsory Resampling And Lossy Compression, Among Others) Cannot Be Overcome Even With The Fanciest Devices And Protocols, So I'D Rank It Close To The Top Of What You Can Get As An Add-On For A Hifi System. For More 'Normal' Usage, There Are Cheaper Options Available.,Excellent Product,Bluetooth Range Is Very Less,Bought It To Connect My Old Sony 5.1 Blueray Home Theater With Mi 4K Box Which Does Not Have Optical Sound Port.

Samsung Is Always Good,Value For Money Product","Before Finalizing The Aue60 55"", I Visited Croma And Vijay Sales To Check For The Same Tv Or Similar Models For Their Features And Picture Quality. I Was Told Aue60 & Aue70(The Models Listed Here As Crystal 4K And 4K Pro) Are E-Commerce Exclusive Models, Not Available Offline. I Was Shown Au7700 Which Has The Same Processor, Panel And Features, But Was Listed At 65K For The 55"" Version. I Liked The Picture Quality, And Decided I'Ll Get The Aue60 Since It Shares So Much With Au7700, And Save ~20K.Why I Went For Aue60  Vs. Aue70 - I Knew I Wouldn'T Be Needing A Voice Assistant, And Wanted To Save 3K. I Knew Even If I Wanted A Voice Assistant, I Could Plug In Fire Tv/Mi Tv Box And Get Those Features Later On. Delivery Was Pretty Hassle Free, The Delivery Executive Unloaded The Tv In The Room I Asked For, And Opened The Box To Inspect The Tv For Any Physical Damages. Samsung Technicians Came In A Few Hours Later, Installed And Gave A Demo.Sound:Per Other Reviews - Sound From Speakers Is Apparently Bad, But In My Case, I Found It Satisfactory. I Have It Wall Mounted In A 10X12Ft Room, And The Tv'S Speakers Sound Better Compared To Bose Soundlink Speakers That I Connected It To Via Bluetooth.Picture:The Panel'S Great, But Nothing Worth Raving About. Gray Uniformity Isn'T Great(I.E. Gray Tones Won'T Be Perfectly Uniform Across The Whole Panel, There'Ll Be Darker Zones Towards The Edges/Corners Based On Backlight Placement). Blacks Aren'T Perfectly Black - And They'Re Brighter Than You'D Expect From A Va Panel, But This Isn'T Noticeable At All When The Room Is Lit. No Backlight Bleed. Colors Are As Good As I'D Like Them To Be, And The Panel Does Get Noticeably Bright For My Taste, Even When Brightness Is Turned Down To 40%. 720P Content Is Watchable From >8Ft, 1080P Is Good(I'D Say Better Than I Expected), And 4K Is Well, 4K.Connectivity:I Have A 35 Mb/S Broadband  Connection And All Content Streams In 4K When Available, Without Stutters. The Tv Has Bluetooth 5.0, And Works With Tws And Neckband Earphones Fine(I Use Oppo Enco W51 And Boat Rockerz 330) - There'S No Noticeable Latency, And Volume Can Be Controlled Through The Remote Itself.Apps & Features:Has All The Standard Slew Of Streaming Apps I Needed - Netflix, Hotstar, Prime, Apple Tv+ & Youtube. All Of Them Stream 4K Content, Except For Hotstar - Which Only Streamed 4K A Few Times. 1080P Is Still Very Watchable, And Not Really A Deal Breaker. No Dolby Vision Support - Which I Made My Peace With Considering The Fact That 99% Of Budget Tvs In The Market Can'T Produce The Contrast You'D Expect Out Of Dv Content Anyways, So Why Care. You Get Hdr, And Hdr Content Is Definitely Better Looking Than Non-Hdr Ones In Terms Of Colors And Vibrancy. I Planned To Use The Tv Without Cable, But The Tv Does Come With Some Channels Like Republic Tv, Bloomberg, 9Xm, Etc., These Stream In 1080P, So A Great Bonus To Have.Remote:Very Basic Rf Remote, Unlike Bluetooth Ones On Most New Tvs. The Remote'S Looks Pretty Sleek And Stylish, But That'S About It. Biggest Gripe - Typing To Search For Things Within Apps Is A Pain In The Behind, You'Ll Need To Use The D-Pad To Navigate On An On-Screen Keyboard. You Can Control The Tv Using Samsung'S Smartthings App, But Guess What - You Can'T Even Use Your Phone'S Keyboard To Type In When Controlling Through The App - This Is Something That Can Be Added Through An Update, But It'S Not There Yet.Attached Pictures Are All Of 4K Content. Resolution Might Get Scaled Down After I Submit The Review, But You Can Still Get An Idea Of The Tv'S Design/Looks, Panel Colors And Contrast, Etc.I'D Say I'M Really Happy - And Given The Chance, Wouldn'T Change My Decision. It'S A Samsung Tv, So End Of The Day, If It Produces A Decent Picture, And Lasts A Couple Of Years More Than I Expect, I Can Overlook All Other Cons. I'D Highly Recommend The Tv If You Have The Same Expectations From Your Next Tv.,,Placed Order On 18Th Dec'22 Received Defective Product, Updated To Amazon Service They Replaced With New Product Today(27/12/22).Will Post Long Term Review.Pros: Picture Quality, Design (Thin N Bezel Less)Cons: Sound (Bit Okay),Upsacling Of Sd Channelsover All Satisfied.,Have Been Using It Since Month Now.-Picture Quality Is Amazing. 4.5/5-As Always Installation Service From Samsung Was Seemless. 5/5-Smart Features Are Good This Model Don'T Have Voice Recognition.

As We Have Trust On Amazon And Also As It Was Coming In My Budget With Good Features I Purchased This Mi 4A Pro Tv.But, Seems Majority Of Good Review/Ratings Are Paid Ones. These Are Cheating Us, Off Course They Didn‚ÄôT Force To Buy, But Being Middle Class Person/Human Being We May Get Attract To Things Which Showing Better In Less Price. Seems This Made/Gave Opportunity To These Sellers To Cheat Us.Amazon Delivery Feedback: I May Not Comment On All Deliveries Happening Not Safely But When It Came To Me It‚ÄôS Not Delivered Safely.This Tv Came For Home Delivery In Troalley Auto Without Proper Placement/Safety, Asked Delivery Person Why Alone Kept It While Coming Due To Up And Downs Of Road It May Fly Right. He Didn‚ÄôT Listen My Words, Simply Said Will Take It Back If Any Physical Damage.He Only Open It And As Outside Nothing See Damage, Delivery Person Said If Any Inner Damage During Installation Time Technician Came To Know And Will Replace It And He Forced Me To Tell Otp To Accept Me Deliver And Left.Tv Installation Feedback: Did By Amazon Technician Personinstead Mi Technician, Amazon Technician Came And Installed This Mi Tv. I Got It Installed Stand Mount As Wall Mount Not Freely Providing.Technician Somehow Explained Tv Usage But Thinking As Not Mi Person Not Have Full Knowledge And Exploring And Telling Each Details.However, Normal Usage Of Tv, This Amazon Technician Help Is Fine.Tv Experience:First Day: Having Slight Less Picture Quality And Few Showing Pixels Not As Required For Eye Safeness.After 3 Or 4 Days: Picture Quality Came Better. Sound/Audio Quality Was Good Either On Ott/Youtbe Or Setup Box/Dthup To 11 Days: As We Not Used Much And Simply Using It For Watch Dth Channels. Everything Looks Good.After 12 Days: Amazon Replacement Time Expired Then Started Showing Sound/Audio Problem.Tv Sound Coming Very Slow, When Installed Time/First 10 Days, If We Set Up Volume 15 Or 20 It Was Able Give Bigger Sound, Now Though We Increase Volume 60 Or 65 Not Giving The Sound That We Heard When It Installed/Setup (Played The Same Content Which We Listen In Youtube When After Installation Completed).Regarding This Yesterday Raised Request, Online Service Person Asked Me To Update Build Version To Latest, Now, It Is Pl.6036 But Still Have The Same Problem.2 Or 3 Days Ago While Watching Suddenly Tv Got Turned Off, We Did Power Off And On Then It Got Switch On Usually, Also After Sometime Did Screen Mirroring Of Youtube And Tried Decreasing Volume From Mobile It Worked. But, Not Sure What Problem, We Believe After That Time Onwards We Have This Sound Issues.Not Sure, Seems As I Bought From This Amazon Or Mi Service Itself Does Magic To Convey Customer Without Actually Solving Problem.Online Service Person Instead Sending Technician To Home For Verifying Problem. Told And Did Build Version Update With Me To Latest (Software Update). Later, He Said Volume Limit Got Increased To 100 Now, We Have To Increase The Volume Level Double Or Triple To Have Same Sound Which Have Prior. I.E. Before If 15/20 Volume Level Gives Big Sound, Then Now 50/60 Volume Level The Same Sound. Asked, When Limit Increased It Should Give Much More Sound Otherwise What Is The Use Of Volume Limit Increase. But, He Told Ott/Some Apps Will Show Difference Of This New Feature, At The Time As I Have Been On This Calls And Worries, Got Tired, I Said Will See And Get Back To You With New Request.After Some Time, When I Visited My Friends/ Better Knowledge Person On This Problem Came To Know That He Cheated Me Without Solving Problem, Simply Said Some Words To Convey/Tired Us.Off Course,  I Can Hear Sound At 60 Or 70 Volume But My Concern Is After Purchase/Installation Of 13 Days Only I Got This Problem, In Future How It Works And How Many Further Problems Shows To Me Making Me Cruise.Being Middle Class Person, We Give Value To Single Rupee Also Because We Know How Much Efforts We Put On To Get That Money. After Purchase Of This Mi Product Crying Lot Why We Went To It Instead We Could Have Went For Further Good Brand Product Though They High In Cost.Now, Not Replaced My Tv Or Not Did Service By Technician. We Decided That We Got Cheated On And Prayed God To Take Care‚Ä¶‚Ä¶,Bought Two Years Ago. My Panel Stopped Displaying Just One Week Before The Warranty Was To Expire After Two Years.

The Tv Is Still Going Strong - All The Good Points Mentioned In The Original Review Below Are Still True And Very Happy With The Tv.It'S As If Oneplus Have Been Listening To Their Customers! After Recent Firmware Updates, The Issues I Had Mentioned Have Almost Disappeared.1. We Can Now Arrange And Move Apps (Youtube, Netflix) As Per Our Wish On The Home Screen Itself. I Am Finally Able To Put Youtube First As It Is The Most Used App For My Toddler.2. There Is No More Wifi Disconnect Issue Noted Earlier.3. Prime Video Still Shows Errors Sometimes. Though I Think That'S An Issue With The App And Not The Tv.Strongly Recommend This Tv!Original Review:I Took A Leap Of Faith In Purchasing This Tv As There Were Mixed Reviews For It. However, After Using It For 2 Months, The Following Are My Observations:Good:1. The Picture Quality Is Fantastic. There Is No Lag While Watching/Forwarding 4K/8K Videos.2. I Saw A Youtube Review Which Said Its Brightness Was Low Compared To Other Models - The Brightness Is More Than You Would Ever Need From A Tv. I Have Never Needed To Run It On Full Brightness Till Now, Up To 40 Works For Me. For My Toddler To Watch Rhymes, I Set Brightness To 0, And Even Then It Is More Than Needed.3. There Were A Few Reviews That Said The Sound Quality Was Average And You Need A Soundbar. I Disagree - I Have Watched Movies With Up To 50 Sound And That Is Good Enough For A 1000 Sqft Hall.4. Voice Command - It Is Quite Accurate And I Am Able To Change Nursery Rhymes For My Toddler While Working In The Kitchen Which Is Around 15 - 20 Feet Away.5. Being Able To Control The Tv From App Is Also A Very Useful Feature - No Need To Look For Remote. Being Able To Cast From The App Also Helps A Lot. It Would Be Even Better If Everything On Phone (Not Just Pictures And Videos) Could Be Cast Using The Appnot So Good:1. If The Tv Goes To Sleep/Screensaver For More Than 10 Minutes,A. It Often Gets Disconnected From Wifi - Have To Restart It Againb. Prime Video Fails To Resume - Displays Error - And Have To Restart The Tv Againc. On The Home Screen, You Cannot Rearrange Apps To Have Your Preferred Apps First. You Can Do It In Apps Window Which Is Useless As You Need To Navigate To It First - Easier To Navigate To Your Preferred App In The Home Screen Itself.,Only Cons Till Now Got, Fast Moving Object Looks Blurr, Which Was Known Before Buying By Other User Review, But I Got This Tv In 32 K,Ao Over All Satishfied,Only Minus That Too Critical Is The Installation Service Provider.The Product Is To Installed By V Care Installation Services Provider.The Installation Service Provider Is A Total Waste And Not Responded Properly.Actual Date Of Installation Was On 21.02.22 But Was Only Done By The Service Provider On 27.10.22.The Executive Who Attended The Installation Is A Total Waste Person And Don'T Know How To Behave To The Customer.He Behaved Very Rudely.The Installation Service Provider Is A Total Damage And Waste.

Some Things-The Whole Step Tracking Thing, I Bought It Due To That Reason, It Didn'T Basically Satisfy Me To That Level With That, But It Does Count Steps Accurately In The Walking Mode(Activity)Its Got Some Scratches In It.. But Its Not That Noticeable At First Glancethe Backgrounds, I Believe It Could'Ve Been Wayyyy Better If We Could Change 4-5 Backgrounds Of 10, But We Can Only Have 2, 1 Customised And 1 Download From The App(Which Has Limited Options)  The Other Backgrounds Are Just.. Eh..The Looks, I'Ll Give It 9/10, It'S Good Looking Stylish Differenttouch Screen Is Goodthe Sleep Tracking Too Is Kinda Accurate(I Still Haven'T Understood It That Well Lol)Battery Life Is Muah, I Use It Without Bluetooth And It Easily Survives For 6-7 Daysspo2 And Heart Rate, I Just Believe What It Says As I Can'T Check Prove If That'S Correct.The Water Resistance, I Haven'T Used It In Water (Ofc Am Scared) The Calling Feature Works Fine.. Its Got Good Sound Overall Its A Decent Watch And Can Be Used In Day To Day Activities, Am Quite Satisfied With It As My First Smart Watch üòó,I'Ve Used This Product For 4 Days, And I'M Going To Rate The Various Features And Different Aspects Of This Smartwatch Which Could Help The Customers Here -So, Bluetooth Calling (4/5) - The In-Built Mic Of This Watch Is Excellent And The Voice Gets To The Other Side Without Any Disturbance, Watch Connects Smoothly With The Mobile And Don'T Get Disconnected Automatically Until You Do It Yourself Through Watch Or Phone. Only Con Is You Can'T Silent The Incoming Call Which Is Annoying Sometime, Hope They Fix It With An Update.Built Quality And Looks (4.5/5) - Metallic Built Which Looks Premium And Straps Are Also Quite Smooth And Comforting. Best Thing Is, It Also Looks Good Over Skinny Wrists(Poor Me, With 5.6 Inch Wrist). Only Con Is You Can Get Scratches On Display So Protect With It Some Sort Of Screen Guard.Touch Screen (5/5) - It'S Almost Buttery Smooth Without Any Lag Which Is Pretty Impressive For A Smartwatch Under 2K. I Bet You Will Not Get Any Laggy Experience Ever.Accuracy (3.5/5) - Spo2 And Hr Has Fairly Decent Accuracies, It Gives You A Rough Idea Of Your Being, So Its Quite Reasonable For A Watch Under 2K. Count Steps With Decent Accuracy As Well. Sleep Accuracy Is Also Just Acceptable.To Sum Up, You Should Definitely Go For This Watch If You'Ve A Budget, Constrained Under 2000 Rs,,I Recently Purchased The Fire Bolt Phoniex Watch, Which Is Quite Stylish, And The Bluetooth Calling Is Excellent. The Voice Gets To The Other Side Without Any Disturbance.The Build Quality Is Good Over The Wrists, But You Can Get Scratches On The Display, So Protect It With Some Screen Guard. You Should Go For This Watch If You Want A Budget-Friendly Smartwatch Under 2000.,It'S A Good Watch But I Have Faced Two Problems In It The First One Is There Is No Feature Of Raise To Wake And The Second One Is There Is No Option To Silent It When Someone Calls You.....I Think You Should Purchase It If In Future Company Add These Two Features...,I Recently Purchased The Fire Boltt Phoenix Watch, And I Am Very Happy With My Purchase. The Watch Is Quite Stylish, And I Get Compliments Every Time I Wear It. The Watch Is Also Quite Comfortable To Wear, And The Strap Is Adjustable To Fit Any Wrist Size. The Watch Also Has A Great Battery Life, And I Can Go For Days Without Having To Charge It. The Watch Also Has A Number Of Features, Including A Step Counter, Heart Rate Monitor, And Sleep Tracker. All Of These Features Are Very Useful And Make It Easy To Track My Activity And Health. Overall, I Am Very Pleased With My Purchase And Would Highly Recommend The Fire Boltt Phoenix Watch To Anyone Who Is Looking For A Stylish And Functional Watch.,This Watch Is Absolutely Stunning And Great Value For Money. Really Pleased With The Design And Shape Of Watch, Definitely A Must Buy For Every Person .Loved The Colour, Durability And Accuracy Is Super üëç.

Now There Are A Few Good Ones To Pick But A Slight Improvement Over The Ones The Watch Earlier Had. Bit Impressed. Added One Star For It.Not A Very Polished Product. The Fonts Are Tacky And Look Ugly In The Watch For Notification Text And Caller Name Text. The Watch Faces Are A Lazy Design Job. No Point Having 150 Watch Faces If Only 10-20 Are Good Or Usable. Rest Are Useless.[Update: Oct 11] Boat Seems To Be On A Smartwatch Launch Spree. And Thanks To That, They Are Constantly Updating The Phone App And The Watch Faces. Now You Have Many Good Looking Watch Faces To Choose From. So Overall, Still The Smartwatch Ui Needs Work.

They Could Have Tried To Give The Chinese Software Some Makeover. But It Is A Clearly Lazy Job By The Tech Team. A Copy Paste Job To Be Precise Of Getting An Outsourced Software And Plastering It With Brand Logos.- Restarts Randomly When The Call Is Going On On The Watch Even For 1 Min Or So.- Watch Faces. Again A Job Of The Design / Tech / Ui Team. Boat Doesn'T Have A Good Team Of Designers And Ui Guys To Really Offer Simple Yet Good Software Features Like Good Watch Faces And Good Watch Ui.- No Option To Silence A Call Or Reply With Quick Replies.Look For Noise Smart Watches In The Same Range.

I Am An Old-Fashioned Mechanical Engineer With A Basic Understanding Of Parameters Like Millimetres, Megapixels And Megabytes ‚Äì But I Think Of A Cellphone As A Utility Item, Not A Status Symbol. Applying A Technocratic Approach, I Would Not Choose A Costlier Option Unless I Get Additional Features Which Suit My Requirements.My Foremost Requirement ‚Äì Which Is Entirely Non-Negotiable ‚Äì Is That My Handset Must Have Provision For Two Sim Cards, Since I Do Not Want To Carry Two Separate Handsets For My Cug And Personal Numbers. My Other Requirements Are Not Difficult To Fulfil: A Phonebook With At Least 2000 Contacts, Basic Net Connectivity, A Basic Camera For Photos And Videos And Scope For Downloading A Few Apps Such As The Ubiquitous Whatsapp And My Favourite Word Games (Which Do Not Need Much Memory Or Processing Capacity). I Would Certainly Appreciate Practical Features Like High Reliability, Software And Security Updates And High Battery Capacity (Sufficient For 24 Hours Or Preferably 48 Hours At My Normal Level Of Usage). Besides, I Would Like To Use A New Handset For At Least Two Years.Apart From Exigencies, I Do Not Intend To Use My Cellphone For Surfing The Internet, Videoconferencing Or Sending E-Mails As I Prefer Using A Desktop Or Laptop For Such Activities.I Am Equally Clear About What I Do Not Need. I Do Not Intend To Use My Cellphone For Watching Movies, Reading Books, Listening To Music Or Creating Fancy Social Media Posts. Nor Do I Want A Device For Taking High Resolution Photos During A Vacation As I Would Prefer To Use A Camera. At The Risk Of Sounding Flippant, I Would Say That I Do Not Want A Device To Unlock My Car Or Count The Strokes In A Game Of Golf ‚Äì Primarily Because I Do Not Own A Car And I Do Not Play Golf!Having Used Smartphones Of Samsung And Motorola Makes Over The Past Few Years, I Vastly Prefer The Former. My Last Phone, Which Gave Me Over 30 Months Of Good Service, Was A Samsung M30. Since That Model Is Obsolete Now, I Focused On Its Upgraded Cousins: M32, M33 And M52. The Last Was Immediately Ruled Out As It Does Not Support Two Sim Cards Along With An Sd Card. After Studying The Relative Specifications Of M32 And M33, I Concluded That The Latter Offers Better Value For Money. Generally, It Is Worth Going For The Higher Memory And Higher Ram Versions As These Parameters Affect The Performance And The Difference In Cost Is Relatively Small. With These Considerations, I Narrowed Down My Choice To M33 With 8Gb Ram And 128Gb Storage (Just Twenty Years Ago, I Was Using A Desktop With 2Gb Memory!)As A Confirmation For My Choice, I Compared The Phone I Had Selected With Oneplus Nord Ce 2 (8Gb Ram, 128Gb Storage) Which My Son Had Recommended. The Specification Of The Samsung Phone Was Found To Be Equivalent Or Superior For The Major Parameters, Except That The Display Screen Technology Was Tft Instead Of Amoled. I Also Watched Some Youtube Videos About These Handsets For A Better Appreciation Of Their Competing Features. The Clinching Factor Was That The Samsung Phone Was Priced Substantially Lower Than The Oneplus Product.As For Body Colour, My First Choice Was Emerald Brown, But I Settled For The Mystique Green Since The Former Was Not Available In My Selected Configuration. I Was Thinking This Would Be Irrelevant Since I Use A Case Which Completely Encloses The Handset, But It Turned Out That The Body Colour Can Be Glimpsed Through The Cutout For The Cameras On The Rear Of The Phone.Despite A Strong Family Resemblance With My Old One (M30), The New Phone (M33) Offers Decidedly Superior Specifications And It Meets My Requirements Perfectly. It Is A Few Millimetres Longer And A Few Grams Heavier Than My Old Phone, But These Differences Are Acceptable To Me. Thanks To The 50Mp Front Camera And 8Mp Selfie Camera, The Quality Of Photos And Videos Is Above My Expectations (See Sample Pic Taken At Night At A Distance Of About 30 Metres From The Stage).  This Phone Offers Two Years Of Android Updates And Four Years Of Security Patch Updates, Which Reduces The Worries On These Fronts. Youtube Reviewers Complain That The M33 Has Plain Looks, It Is Heavy, Its Audio Does Not Offer An ‚ÄòImmersive Listening Experience‚Äô And Its Screen Is Plain Old Tft Instead Of Amoled. I Am Willing To Live With These Perceived Shortcomings, So Long As The M33 Meets My Requirements.I Was Glad To Find That Samsung Has Taken An Environmentally Friendly Step Of Offering Many Models Of Handsets Without Chargers ‚Äì Because Old Chargers, Like Old Handsets, Add To E-Waste. However, It Needs To Be Kept In Mind That New Handsets Require Higher Capacity Chargers. The Recommended Charger For M33 Is 25 Watts, But The Chargers I Had At Home Are Rated At 5 Or 10 Watts.To Cut A Long Story Short, I Ordered A 25-Watt Charger Along With The Phone To Avoid Compromising With The Charging Time. After Using The New Handset For A Couple Of Weeks, I Find That My Phone Is At 60-70% Charge At The End Of The Day, And It Takes 30-40 Minutes For Complete Charging (One Of The Useful Features Of M33 Is That It Shows The Time Remaining For Complete Charging As Soon As It Is Plugged In For Charging). It Turns Out That I Could Have Managed With The Old 10-Watt Charger, Except That It Would Have Taken 60-90 Minutes For Full Charging.I Conclude By Emphasizing That Samsung Galaxy M33 5G Is The Perfect Phone ‚Äì But For My Requirements.

I Was Even Mentally Prepared For A Bad Camera, Based On Some Reviews Here. But I Was Pleasantly Surprised That Camera Clicks Good Photos. They Are Not Awesome, But They Are Decent Photos That Can Even Be Shared.Now Coming To My Biggest Grouse; Heating Issue. The Phone Started Heating Up While Charging, But It Was Just A Little And So I Could Have Ignored It. But Then It Started Heating Up More And Got Me Very Concerned. I Even Ordered A Replacement Thinking I Got A Defective Piece. But Then, After Further Tests, I Found That It Is Heating More When I Download Huge Amounts Of Data, For Example, When I Restore Data Of My Old Phone, From Back Up. This Is Ok With Me As, I Don'T Perform Huge Data Loads Regularly, Definitely Not On Phone. Then I Tested By Running Tasks I Usually Perform Such As Checking Office Mails, Attending Office Meeting On Phone, Watching A Video From Amazon Prime, And So On. The Phone Did Not Heat Up Even A Little. Personally, This Is Good For Me.At This Price Range, This Is A Good Phone. But If You Are Camera Heavy User And Expect To Perform Heavy Downloads Frequently, This Phone May Not For You. I Am Personally Satisfied With This Phone As It Works For My Type Of Usage. I Will Not Go Into Plus Points Of This Phone As They Are Covered By Other Reviews Already. I Am Only Attempting To Clarify About How This Phone Can Suit You (Or Not) In Terms Of Camera And Heating. I Had Many Questions About These Aspects Before Buying. Perhaps This Review Will Help You Make An Informed Decision To Buy (Or Avoid).

I Am An Old-Fashioned Mechanical Engineer With A Basic Understanding Of Parameters Like Millimetres, Megapixels And Megabytes ‚Äì But I Think Of A Cellphone As A Utility Item, Not A Status Symbol. Applying A Technocratic Approach, I Would Not Choose A Costlier Option Unless I Get Additional Features Which Suit My Requirements.My Foremost Requirement ‚Äì Which Is Entirely Non-Negotiable ‚Äì Is That My Handset Must Have Provision For Two Sim Cards, Since I Do Not Want To Carry Two Separate Handsets For My Cug And Personal Numbers. My Other Requirements Are Not Difficult To Fulfil: A Phonebook With At Least 2000 Contacts, Basic Net Connectivity, A Basic Camera For Photos And Videos And Scope For Downloading A Few Apps Such As The Ubiquitous Whatsapp And My Favourite Word Games (Which Do Not Need Much Memory Or Processing Capacity). I Would Certainly Appreciate Practical Features Like High Reliability, Software And Security Updates And High Battery Capacity (Sufficient For 24 Hours Or Preferably 48 Hours At My Normal Level Of Usage). Besides, I Would Like To Use A New Handset For At Least Two Years.Apart From Exigencies, I Do Not Intend To Use My Cellphone For Surfing The Internet, Videoconferencing Or Sending E-Mails As I Prefer Using A Desktop Or Laptop For Such Activities.I Am Equally Clear About What I Do Not Need. I Do Not Intend To Use My Cellphone For Watching Movies, Reading Books, Listening To Music Or Creating Fancy Social Media Posts. Nor Do I Want A Device For Taking High Resolution Photos During A Vacation As I Would Prefer To Use A Camera. At The Risk Of Sounding Flippant, I Would Say That I Do Not Want A Device To Unlock My Car Or Count The Strokes In A Game Of Golf ‚Äì Primarily Because I Do Not Own A Car And I Do Not Play Golf!Having Used Smartphones Of Samsung And Motorola Makes Over The Past Few Years, I Vastly Prefer The Former. My Last Phone, Which Gave Me Over 30 Months Of Good Service, Was A Samsung M30. Since That Model Is Obsolete Now, I Focused On Its Upgraded Cousins: M32, M33 And M52. The Last Was Immediately Ruled Out As It Does Not Support Two Sim Cards Along With An Sd Card. After Studying The Relative Specifications Of M32 And M33, I Concluded That The Latter Offers Better Value For Money. Generally, It Is Worth Going For The Higher Memory And Higher Ram Versions As These Parameters Affect The Performance And The Difference In Cost Is Relatively Small. With These Considerations, I Narrowed Down My Choice To M33 With 8Gb Ram And 128Gb Storage (Just Twenty Years Ago, I Was Using A Desktop With 2Gb Memory!)As A Confirmation For My Choice, I Compared The Phone I Had Selected With Oneplus Nord Ce 2 (8Gb Ram, 128Gb Storage) Which My Son Had Recommended. The Specification Of The Samsung Phone Was Found To Be Equivalent Or Superior For The Major Parameters, Except That The Display Screen Technology Was Tft Instead Of Amoled. I Also Watched Some Youtube Videos About These Handsets For A Better Appreciation Of Their Competing Features. The Clinching Factor Was That The Samsung Phone Was Priced Substantially Lower Than The Oneplus Product.As For Body Colour, My First Choice Was Emerald Brown, But I Settled For The Mystique Green Since The Former Was Not Available In My Selected Configuration. I Was Thinking This Would Be Irrelevant Since I Use A Case Which Completely Encloses The Handset, But It Turned Out That The Body Colour Can Be Glimpsed Through The Cutout For The Cameras On The Rear Of The Phone.Despite A Strong Family Resemblance With My Old One (M30), The New Phone (M33) Offers Decidedly Superior Specifications And It Meets My Requirements Perfectly. It Is A Few Millimetres Longer And A Few Grams Heavier Than My Old Phone, But These Differences Are Acceptable To Me. Thanks To The 50Mp Front Camera And 8Mp Selfie Camera, The Quality Of Photos And Videos Is Above My Expectations (See Sample Pic Taken At Night At A Distance Of About 30 Metres From The Stage).  This Phone Offers Two Years Of Android Updates And Four Years Of Security Patch Updates, Which Reduces The Worries On These Fronts. Youtube Reviewers Complain That The M33 Has Plain Looks, It Is Heavy, Its Audio Does Not Offer An ‚ÄòImmersive Listening Experience‚Äô And Its Screen Is Plain Old Tft Instead Of Amoled. I Am Willing To Live With These Perceived Shortcomings, So Long As The M33 Meets My Requirements.I Was Glad To Find That Samsung Has Taken An Environmentally Friendly Step Of Offering Many Models Of Handsets Without Chargers ‚Äì Because Old Chargers, Like Old Handsets, Add To E-Waste. However, It Needs To Be Kept In Mind That New Handsets Require Higher Capacity Chargers. The Recommended Charger For M33 Is 25 Watts, But The Chargers I Had At Home Are Rated At 5 Or 10 Watts.To Cut A Long Story Short, I Ordered A 25-Watt Charger Along With The Phone To Avoid Compromising With The Charging Time. After Using The New Handset For A Couple Of Weeks, I Find That My Phone Is At 60-70% Charge At The End Of The Day, And It Takes 30-40 Minutes For Complete Charging (One Of The Useful Features Of M33 Is That It Shows The Time Remaining For Complete Charging As Soon As It Is Plugged In For Charging). It Turns Out That I Could Have Managed With The Old 10-Watt Charger, Except That It Would Have Taken 60-90 Minutes For Full Charging.I Conclude By Emphasizing That Samsung Galaxy M33 5G Is The Perfect Phone ‚Äì But For My Requirements. A Word Of Advice: If You Are Planning To Buy A New Phone, It Would Be Helpful If You List Out Your Requirements So That You Do Not End Up Paying For Features That You Do Not Intend To Use.,With 5G Connectivity, A 120Hz Display And Solid Performance, The Galaxy M33 5G Is Samsung‚ÄôS Best-Value Smartphone Yet Under 20K Segmentpros¬†Almost Half The Price Of Galaxy A53Exynos 1280 Is A Solid Performerexcellent 120Hz Display With Smooth Experience Across The Boardhuge Performance Uplift Over M32One Ui 4.1 Based On Android 12 Has Tons Of Good Features To Love, None Of The Flagship Grade Features Are Skipped Here (Apart From Dex Mode And Spen Features), Zero Lag Or Stuttering In 120 Hz Mode With Ease Of Use And Seemless Switching Of Apps Without Any Crash Or Reloading¬† Of Apps, Makes Using One Ui Pleasure To Surf Acrossyou Get Features Like A¬†Screen Recorder,¬†Video Call Effects, Game Launcher,¬†Link To Windows,¬†Dual Messenger,¬†Quick Share,¬†Music Share, And Secure Folder, Along With Many Others.

Even My Voice Is Reaching To Opposite Party Very Clearly While Calling With Watch.# Calculator Features Is Useful# Multi Functional Crown Button Is Easy And Useful .. Easily To Change Theme With Just Scroll The Crown Button# Play Music Directly From The Watch With The Internal Storage Although Its Only 128 Mb But Sufficient To Store Around 10 Songs Approx.. Song Sound Quality Is Also Fine# Strap Quality Is Good And Soft# Tws Connecting Features Is Also Nicecons# Sometimes I Found Watch Is Disconnected With My Phone  ..Not Sure Why Its Happened As I Have Checked Only For One Day# Fingerprints Are Clearly Visible On  Screen Glass .. I Have Attached The Pic For It#Health Tracker Are Near To Accurate But Never Rely On Smartwatch At This Price Range.I Have Measure The Bp With This Watch And With Bp Machine Both Results Are Different... 70-80% Accurate Only..# Ai Voice Assistant Is Not Very Useful As It Only Work For Mobile When I Press The Voice Assistant Button On Watch .. Like If I Give Command To Set Alarm On Watch It Set Alarm On Mobile So Basically It Just A Button To Wake Up Google Assistant For Mobile Phone.#Sometimes When You Pick Call From Your Mobile Phone Call Automatically Transfer To Watch And Voice Started Coming From The Watch Speaker.. Which Is Quite Irritating..This Must Be Correct By Firmware Updates I Have Purchased It For Rs.3420/- Including Bank Offer . For This Price Range Overall Its A Good & Premium Watch ..Its My Experience With This Watch For Just A One Dayrest How It Work For Long Run That Depends..,Recieved A Damaged Device At First... Slight Gap Between Display And Body From The Left Side.. But Quickly Recieved The Replacement Next Day....The Replacement Was Good...Amazon Provided Great Service And Delivered Replacement In Just 16 Hours ...So Great Job Amazon..Also I Live In Bangalore.. So The Experience Might Vary From Place To Place..Prossmooth Enough Uifairly Accurate Readings On All The Sensorsheartrate Bp And Spo2Call Quality Is Great For The Price.. Good Speakers And Good Mic..You Can Control Spotify And Soundcloud Music Too From The Watch .And Use Tws To Listen To Spotify While Controling With The Watch... And It Is Seamless...Display Is Great ..Colors Are Punchy And Bezels Are Good Enough... Not As Narrow As Crossbeats Ignite S4 Max But Still Good Enough...Build Quality Is Good But Does Not Feel Very Premium.. It Does Feel Like A Below 5K Watch...So You Cannot Trick Anyone That This Is A Apple Watch üòÇStrap Is Not Too Long As Every Review Mentions.. Strap Is Good Enough... Not Too Comfy..I Ordered A Metal Strap From Amazon For My Watch And It Is Amazing...Ui Looks Much Better In Person Than Reviews.. Ui Is Smooth And Looks Good... Not As Good As Realme Watch 3 Pro..But Still Good For The Price..Overall Its A Good Watch For The Price Of Around 3.5K -3.9Kanymore And It Is Not Worth The Pricerealme Watch 3Pro Is The Best At Around This Price.. So If You Get That In Stock And For Below 4K Then Get Realme Watch 3 Pro..Or Else For This Price Segment Firebolt Visionary Is The Overall Best Watch Compared To All Other Watches Under 4Kconscall When Recieved On Watch Doesnt Stay On Tws It Switches To Watch For Some Reason..Which Is Onesteps Are A Little Inaccurate And Reads Steps Even If Not Walking..So Dont Rely On Step Counterbattery Life Is Not Great If Youre Using Always On Display And Calling... Maybe Around 3 Daysbut Otherwise Battery Stays For Over 5 Days.Blutooth Range Is Not Too Good.. And Varies From Watch To Watch.. And Also Phone To Phone.. I Get A Decent Bluetooth Range Of Around 20 Ft .. But This Is More Of A Fact Than A Con..,I Write This Review After 1 Week Of Using This Watch, Bp, Bpm, Spo2 Running And Sleep Tracking Functions Are Working Well, Watch Speaker Is Also Loud And Clear To You And The Other Callers. The Only Con Is When You Want To Listen To Songs Through A Watch From A Mobile Its Bluetooth Disconnects Automatically Again And Again, As This Fund Is Not Useful For Me So Ignore It, Overall It'S A Good Watch.,Everything Is Absolutely Greta In This Smartwatch.But These Things Could Have Been Better:. Watch Faces- You Should Have The Option To Add Upto 3-4 Watch Faces At Once From The App Rather Than One At A Time And 10 Pre-Installed Ones. App Ui Could Have Been Better. Dnd Mode Absent. No Option To Toggle Bluetooth (Always On),Before Review I Would Like To Appreciate This Great Strategy To Pour Out Honest Reviews From Users By Giving Them Bookmyshow Voucher.I Loved The Touch Screen Experience & Amoled Screen Of The Watch, It Gives A Feel Of Premium Watch. The Band Of The Watch Is Average & Doesn'T Look Premium & I Separately Ordered A Metal Band. I Am Expecting Mobile App Improvement From Fireboltt As I Don'T Find It Good Enough If I Compare It With Boat'S App For Its Watches (As I Own A Boat Smartwatch). Rest Visionary Is A Good Buy & Worth The Money The Only Thing Which Physically Is Not Appealing Is The Average Quality Of The Band.",Https://M.Media-Amazon.Com/Images/I/41R1D8A2Wgl._Sx300_Sy300_Ql70_Ml2_.Jpg,Https://Www.Amazon.In/Fire-Boltt-Smartwatch-Resolution-Connection-Assistance/Dp/B0B3N7Lr6K/Ref=Sr_1_44?Qid=1672895755&S=Electronics&Sr=1-44

Color Is Typical Samsung Style With Oversaturated Greens. Interesting To Note That Jn1 Is Also Being Used In Samsung'S New F23.Thermal Management Is Very Poor. Device Heats Up In Normal Usage Within Minutes If The Screen Brightness Is High. Same Is The Case When Camera App Is Opened/Simple Games On Flipkart Gamezone Are Played. There Are Reports On Youtube Of Narzo50'S Camera Shutting Down On Hot Days.Above Scenarios And 120Hz Adaptive Refresh Rate Also Drain Battery Like Crazy.Speaker And Earpiece Do Not Have Crispiness (Upper Treble), Instead Sound Like White Noise. Earpiece Volume Is Low. So Is The Speaker Volume When On Call. On The Other Hand, Speaker Volume Is Decent While Playing Back Videos.Flashlight Is Half As Bright As Normal Smartphones. I Don'T Really Know If Company Did Cost Cutting Here, Or Its A Software Bug.No Fm Radio And Secondary Mic.Minor Features I Missed If Shifting From Miui To Realmeui - E.G. The Gallery App Is Not As Good As Miui One, Requiring More Taps For Basic Opeeations Like Viewing Whatsapp Images Folder.Mediocre Ram Management With Realmeui 2, Android 11.To Be Fair, I Could Not Find Any Major Bug In Realmeui 2.0 So Far. The Lcd Display Is Fantastic, And Very Well Calibrated With Relatively Cooler White Point, As Opposed To Yellowish 5500-6500K Super Amoled. There Was No Green Or Purple Tint. Touch Response Was Excellent. Screen Protector, Case, Fast Charger, Usb C Cable Were Present. The Phone Feels Much Slimmer Than My Bulky F22 Due To Its Thin Body, 10Gm Less Weight And Sleek Case. Camera App Has Full Fledged Manual Mode, Something Absent From Samsung'S F22.Disclaimer: Above Impression Has Been Made After Using 4 Smartphones Over Last 8 Years: Asus Zenfone 5, Redmi 4, Redmi 7A, Samsung F22.Strongly Consider Other Current Alternatives Too, Like Redmi Note 11, Poco M4 Pro, Poco M4 Pro 5G, Redmi Note 10T 5G,  Samsung F22, Samsung F23, Moto G42 Before Buying Narzo 50.More Info: Do Not Fall For Bloatwares Like Glance When Setting Up The Phone. Check As Few Check Boxes As Possible Before Blindly Clicking 'I Agree'. Turn Off Content Recommendation By Going To The Settings -> Additional Settings -> Get Recommendations And Switch The Green Toggle Off. To Remove Bloatwares That Cannot Be Uninstalled Usual Way, Follow Excellent Guide By Youtuber 'Tech Office' Mentioning All Realme App Names Required For Adb Commands. I Was Able To Uninstall Hot Apps/Games This Way.Update:Detailed Camera Comparison Between Samsung F22 And Narzo 50:Samsung'S Hdr Algo Seems More Sophisticated, Narzo Unnaturally Brightens Some Shadows Too Much, There Is Also Some Oversharpening.Both Cameras Choose Cool Auto White Balance, Which Results In Bluer Skies But Lifeless Greeneries Even In 'Golden Hours'. However, Narzos Colors Become More 'Hue Accurate' After Choosing 6000-6500K White Point In 'Expert Mode', Whereas Samsung Still Delivers Bluish Green Foliage Colors At Cloudy White Balance. Narzo Strangely Does Some Weak Auto Hdr Even In 'Expert Mode', But Samsung Fully Turns It Off In 'Pro Mode', Resulting Unusable Photos.However, When Using Night Mode, Narzo'S Photos Appear More Cleaner But Less Saturated At Night.  Gcam 8.5 For Narzo Is Not Optimized Properly And Gives Noisy Night Photos With Greenish Cast And Crushed Shadows, Much Worse Than Realme'S Night Mode. On The Other Hand, Thereas No Gcam And No Camera2Api Support For F22. At Night, You Can Take Long Exposure Shots (Upto 8/16/32Secs) Through 'Expert Mode' By Manually Choosing Shutter Speed In Narzo, Something You Can'T Do In F22. This However Requires Tripod Support And Whenever Done Properly, The Results Are Very Good.You Have Manual 'Film' Mode In Narzo, Whereas You Can'T Even Manually Set White Balance In F22'S Video Mode, As Samsung'S Lower End Galaxys Don'T Have 'Pro Video' Mode.,This Mobile Is Suitable For Every Oneit'S Goodbut Camara Is Average,Https://M.Media-Amazon.Com/Images/I/719Pusga96L._Sy88.Jpg,Good Quality,Very Good Phone .Iam Very Happy With This While Using.Thank You Amaon.,I Had Purchased This Phone In 10K And This Phone Is Actually Brilliant In This Price Range, Camera Is Good, Fingerprint Sensor Is Good, Back Panel Is Good (I Purchased Black One) , No Hang But There Is A Small Problem That Battery Drains Little Faster And When You Click Home Button, Google Assistant Appears Most Of The Time Which Is Quite Annoying Sometimes, Overall I Am Happy With The Phone .,I Wanted An Affordable Phone ; This Fits The Bill Perfectly.,Fantastic Finger Reader, Battery Sustainability For A Long Time Usage, And Hd Quality Natural Photographs.

My Suggestion Is That It Should Be More Length.,Everything Is Perfect Except If You Pull The Tripod To A Long Hight,Superb,Good At All.,I Haven'T Used It Much, Product Is Good.

Best Thing Is, It Also Looks Good Over Skinny Wrists(Poor Me, With 5.6 Inch Wrist). Only Con Is You Can Get Scratches On Display So Protect With It Some Sort Of Screen Guard.Touch Screen (5/5) - It'S Almost Buttery Smooth Without Any Lag Which Is Pretty Impressive For A Smartwatch Under 2K. I Bet You Will Not Get Any Laggy Experience Ever.Accuracy (3.5/5) - Spo2 And Hr Has Fairly Decent Accuracies, It Gives You A Rough Idea Of Your Being, So Its Quite Reasonable For A Watch Under 2K. Count Steps With Decent Accuracy As Well. Sleep Accuracy Is Also Just Acceptable.To Sum Up, You Should Definitely Go For This Watch If You'Ve A Budget, Constrained Under 2000 Rs,,I Recently Purchased The Fire Bolt Phoniex Watch, Which Is Quite Stylish, And The Bluetooth Calling Is Excellent. The Voice Gets To The Other Side Without Any Disturbance.The Build Quality Is Good Over The Wrists, But You Can Get Scratches On The Display, So Protect It With Some Screen Guard. You Should Go For This Watch If You Want A Budget-Friendly Smartwatch Under 2000.,It'S A Good Watch But I Have Faced Two Problems In It The First One Is There Is No Feature Of Raise To Wake And The Second One Is There Is No Option To Silent It When Someone Calls You.....I Think You Should Purchase It If In Future Company Add These Two Features...,I Recently Purchased The Fire Boltt Phoenix Watch, And I Am Very Happy With My Purchase. The Watch Is Quite Stylish, And I Get Compliments Every Time I Wear It. The Watch Is Also Quite Comfortable To Wear, And The Strap Is Adjustable To Fit Any Wrist Size. The Watch Also Has A Great Battery Life, And I Can Go For Days Without Having To Charge It. The Watch Also Has A Number Of Features, Including A Step Counter, Heart Rate Monitor, And Sleep Tracker. All Of These Features Are Very Useful And Make It Easy To Track My Activity And Health. Overall, I Am Very Pleased With My Purchase And Would Highly Recommend The Fire Boltt Phoenix Watch To Anyone Who Is Looking For A Stylish And Functional Watch.,This Watch Is Absolutely Stunning And Great Value For Money. Really Pleased With The Design And Shape Of Watch, Definitely A Must Buy For Every Person .Loved The Colour, Durability And Accuracy Is Super üëç. Just Go For It.,I Liked The Product It Has So Many Features Like Sleep Tracking, Sp02, Heart Rate Measuring, Music Player, Temperature Checker My Only Nitpick Would Be That It Only Have 2 Games And Secondly It Has Good Wallpapers But A Ben 10 Omnitrix Wallpaper Would Give It An Even More Awesome Look",Https://M.Media-Amazon.Com/Images/I/41-Ckeknjyl._Sx300_Sy300_Ql70_Ml2_.Jpg,Https://Www.Amazon.In/Fire-Boltt-Phoenix-Bluetooth-Calling-Monitoring/Dp/B0B3Rsdsz3/Ref=Sr_1_54?Qid=1672895762&S=Electronics&Sr=1-54

My Budget Was Around 20K Max, And This One Somehow Fit In All Ways. I Had Almost Finalized One Plus Nord Ce, But Changed My Mind At The Last Moment And I Don'T Regret. I'Ve Used Redmi Phones Before So I'M Aware Of The Sturdiness And Value For Money They Offer. Got This For 13K With Close To 6K+ Exchange On My One Year Old Tecno Spark 7 Phone (One Of The Worst Phones I'Ve Ever Used, Refer To My Tecno Spark 7 Review For That). Here'S My Review Of This Phone Based On 2 Months Of Usage:Pros:1. Build Quality Is Good. Finishing And Lookwise It'S Sleek And Quite Comfortable In Hand.2. Back Camera Is Really Good, Better With The Ai Camera. The 108 Mp Gives Good Pictures, Although Not Comparable To Iphone Or Google Pixel Quality, But For The Price Range It'S Not Bad. Portrait Mode Gives Great Pictures In Well Lit Conditions, Decent In Low Light With Night Mode.3. 67W Charger Is Very Efficient. Phone Gets Fully Charged Within 40-45 Mins From Below 10% Battery Levels. Battery Backup Is Decent, With Normal Usage Charge Easily Lasts For One And A Half Day Or More.4. Dolby Atmos Dual Speakers Are Really Good! You Could Be Watching Movies On This And Feel The Surround Sound Through The Speakers. Pretty Loud Too.5. No Lagging And Smooth Touch, Refresh Rate Is Pretty Good.6. Unlike Some Of The Earlier Redmi Phones Or Chinese Phones In General, There Are Negligible Auto Installing Bloatwares. Android 11 Performance So Far Has Been Satisfactory.7. Hasslefree Usage In General, Something That I Struggled With A Lot With My Earlier Techno Spark Phone For Basic Functionalities.Cons:1. Front Camera Could'Ve Been A Lot Better. In Daylight Conditions, Picture Colors Aren'T Vibrant Enough, And In Low Light, Pictures Come Grainy. Dissatisfied With That.2. Amoled Display Isn'T As Good As I Had Expected, Especially Becomes Evident When Light Reflects On The Screen While You'Re Watching Something.Nothing Else Worth Mentioning That I Can Think Of Right Now. May Update This Review If Anything Encountered.For People With 15-20K Budget Looking For A Good Overall Usage Phone Having 5G, This Phone  Is Worth A Shot Along With Nord Ce 2 Lite.,Nice Phone With Good Battery Backup,Fast Charging, Sturdy Body And Good Process Speed... Camera Quality Is Not Good Enough..But Overall.. Good Budget Phone..,1) Battery Is Decent2) Charging Is Very Fast3) Camera Is Averagingoverall Nice Product,The Phone Is Good From All Aspects Bug If Ur Looking For A Good Camera This Is Not The One.,The Price Of The Product Is Higher At The Time Of Launch.

Calls Getting Disconnected - I Had Call With My Brother Last Night And We Talked For 50 Min And Call Did Not Disconnect In The Middle.2. Heating Issue - While In Day To Day Use Never Faced Heating Issue But It Gets A Little Hot While Charging, I Can Understand Because Of Massive Fast Charging Which Is Understandable. Every Phone With Fast Charging Heats A Little.3. Camera Quality - It Has A Decent 64 Mp Samsung Camera Module Which Is Justified At Price It Comes. You Can Judge The Camera Based On How Well It Performs Indoor With Artificial Lighting Conditions And This Has Done Good. Attached Pic Of Cake Which I Clicked Indoor Only Bright Light Source Was Candle. It Performed Well I Can Say.(To People Who Complaint About Camera -  I Just Cannot Expect Picture Clarity Of Apple Or Samsung High End Devices, I Have To Set My Expectations Right For The Price We Have Paid)4. Antutu Benchmark Score - While Company Claim Of 740000+ While I Tested I Got A Score Of 700000+ . I Again Cannot Complaint Here Because I Don'T Know What Was The Testing Conditions And Criteria That Company Had Followed While Testing. 700000+ Is Pretty Decent Score I Can Say5. Phone Lag - In Two Days Of Testing It Has Not Lagged At All. With Multiple Background Apps Running.6. Battery Drain - Revisit Few Of The Settings On Your Device, Like Animation, Transition Effect Etc To Get Most Out Of Your Battery. If Your Batter Is Set Of Monstor Mode Set It To Normal Or Battery Saver To Make Most. Again Battery Depends Of Usage Of Individual And I Cannot Blame Company. While I Started To Write This Review My Cell Phone Was At 100%. Now It'S Almost 25 Min Typing Till Now It'S Now Showing 99%, I Have Set My Screen At Full Brightness, I Fell Its Decent. Also Tested Charging Speed 0 To 50 In 12.03 Min.7. Build Quality - It'S Sturdy And Decent Plastic Is Used. I Can Say At This Price Point They Should Have Provided Glass Build But Again Considering All Price Benefit You Have Got While Buying This Phone No Complaint (Card Discount + Exchange Benefit Etc) . Still I Would Take Out 1 Star Here.8. Black Colour Issue - Did Not Face Any Problem With Screen Leak Or Black Colour. It'S Amoled Screen. Black Is Highlight Of Amoled. In Case You Were Using Ips / Fhd Panel On Your Previous Phone You Will Have Trouble Distinguishing. I Have Samsung M51 As Secondary Device And I See Black Similar On Both.9. Bgmi - I Played Few Rounds Yesterday And Did Not Face Any Frame Drop Or Lag.10. Two Year Warranty - They Calaimed To Provide Two Year Warranty On This Device But During Registration It Shows Only 1 Year. I Have Personally Wrote To Iqoo Team And Amazon Team Seeking An Answer, With Screenshots Waiting For Answer.Btw Majority Of Phone Manufacturers Provide 1 Year Warranty Only, Even Iphone. Here I Would Say Fight For You Justice And Seek Answer From Iqoo Or Amazon Team.11. Video Call Lag - Did Not Face Any, Did Multiple Video Calls Yesterday With Different People, Did Not Get Any Complaint From Them About My Video Lag. For All Of Them My Video Popped Up Instantaneous.Overall I Would Say I Had A Great Buy And Can Recommend This Device To Others , For All The Folks Bombarding Negative Reviews, I Would Say First Set Your Expectations Right And You Will Be Satisfied. In Case Even Still You Are Facing Problem Then You Have Every Right To Complaint And Get Justice.Overall I Give This Device A 4 Star As Of Now Since I Am Yet To Test This Device Long Term Like 3 Months Or 4 Months.*Please Excuse Any Typos Or Grammatical Errors If Any. Entire Review Was Typed On My Phone Iqoo Neo 6.,I Have Been Using A Budget Phone Realme 3 Since 2019 (Dynamic Black, 3Gb/64Gb). It Served Me Well, But It Was Time For An Upgrade. I Was Looking For A Midrange Model This Time That Would Have Almost Everything I Wanted Within My Budget. Did I Get One? Let‚ÄôS Dig Into It!The Good# Price. After Discounts, I Got A Phone With Practically All The Features I Wanted.# Iqoo Is Basically From Vivo, An Internationally Recognized Brand. Hopefully, I Don‚ÄôT Have To Worry About Software Updates For At Least 3 Years. Iqoo Is Already Doing Good As I Have Received 3 Security Updates So Far For The Android 12 That Came Out Of The Box. I Will Keep An Eye On The Security Updates And Os Upgrades As It Will Make Me Decide Whether To Go For Vivo/Iqoo For My Next Phone.# Dual 5G Sim Support, Which Is Futuristic. With 4G, The Call Quality Has Been Superb So Far.# E4 Amoled 120 Hz 1300 Nits (Peak) 1080X2400 Pixels Display With 6000000:1 Contrast Ratio, 360 Hz Touch Sampling Rate And Hdr10+ (Netflix Hdr Supported). A Huge Upgrade From My Previous Phone. The Photos, Ott Movies Look Too Good. Easier To Read Contents Like Messages, Emails Or Documents.# 64 Mp Main Cam With Ois. Ois Was A Must-Have Feature For Me Since I Could Be Taking A Lot Of Low-Light Photos.# 4700 Mah Battery With 80W Flashcharge Technology; 50% In 12 Min, 100% In 32 Min. Works As Claimed. The Battery Life Has Been Satisfactory.# Sd 870 Cpu. Not One Of The Flagship Processors Today, But Highly Capable, And Fantastic At This Price. Inclusion Of 12 Gb Ram Has Made This Phone A Buttery-Smooth One For Running Apps (Android Is Quite A Ram Dependent Os Unlike Ios). Up To 4 Gb Of Phone Storage Can Be Used For Extended Ram. Currently, I Have 100+ Apps Installed (Mostly Productivity Apps, But No Gaming Apps). The Cascade Cooling System Seems To Be Working.# 256 Gb Rom With Ufs 3.1. Since Phones Nowadays Tend To Ditch A Dedicated Microsdxc Slot, And This Phone Is No Exception, I Did Not Want The 128 Gb Variant. A Fast, Large Internal Rom Is Better Than An External Card As The Latter Loads The Apps, Files Slower.# The In-Display Fingerprint Reader Works Well.# The Stereo Speakers Are Reasonably Good.# Infrared Port (Ir Blaster). I Have Not Tried Using It As A Remote, But A Must Try.# Usb-C Port With Usb-C To Usb-A Data Cable That Connects To The Phone Charger. Some Of Us Prefer A Usb-C To Usb-C Data Cable Instead As It Is More Friendly To The Modern Devices, But I Can See Why Iqoo Decided To Provide A Usb-C To Usb-A. Most Laptops Still Come With Usb-A Ports (Even My Recent Hp 250 G8 Laptop From The Company I Work For Does Have A Usb-C Port Without Power Delivery, And Two Usb-A Ports!). My Powerbanks Don‚ÄôT Have Usb-C Ports Either.# Screenshots, Lock Screen Virtual Buttons. Must As Using Physical Buttons Frequently For These Functions Can Potentially Damage The Buttons.The Bad# Google Backup. A Fail. Since I Did Not Have A Usb-C To Usb-C Cable, I Had To Choose The Wi-Fi Data Transfer Option From My Old Phone To This One. Although I Selected All The Files, Google Failed To Transfer Many Files Especially The Pdfs. Dear Google, This Is Unacceptable.# Spam Handling. My Realme 3 Lets Me Block Any Sms I Want, But This One Does Not. In My Opinion, Every Modern Phone Must Have A Native App That Can Identify The Caller And Help Block A Number Or An Sms As Needed. I Have Stopped Using A 3Rd Party App Like Truecaller, Which Has Become A Truly Rogue App.# No 3.5 Mm Jack (A Plus When You Don'T Have A Bluetooth Earphone, Or Don'T Prefer One), But Iqoo Thankfully Included A Usb-C To 3.5 Mm Adapter In The Box.# The Absence Of Gorilla Glass Protection Is Not A Good Thing, But I Do Not Mind As I Barely Drop My Phone, And The Phone Came With An Already Applied Tempered Glass Screen Protector, And A Transparent Back Cover. Really Appreciated. The Plastic Body Does Not Bother Me; Moreover, The Dark Nova Color Feels Cool. Ymmv.# In My Realme 3 (And Not In My Realme C2, Which Means It Is A Custom Feature From Realme For Specific Os Versions), If I Try Turning Off The Daily Wakeup Alarm, It Gives Me Options Like ‚ÄúTurn Off On‚Ä¶‚Äù (The Next Day For Which The Alarm Is Active), ‚ÄúDo Not Repeat Any More‚Äù, Or ‚ÄúCancel‚Äù. This Is A Fabulous Feature As It Allows Me To Turn Off The Alarm For A Particular Day (Say, An Upcoming Leave Or Holiday) Without Turning It Off For The Following Days! Unfortunately, This Artificial Intelligence Is Not Available In My Iqoo Neo 6 5G.Always Buy A Recently Released Model If You Are Going For An Android Phone. This Will Make Sure That You Get Software Support For Long Enough Time. Moreover, Avoid Buying The Variant With Lowest Ram/Rom. And, Fast Charging Is A Necessity As You See That You Are Hooked Up With Your Phone All The Time.I Have Used This Phone For ~ 2 Months And Will Update This Review As I Keep Using It. Till Date, I Am Quite Satisfied With Iqoo Neo 6 5G (I Also Liked The Funtouch Os), And Recommend It To Anybody Who Has Needs Like Me.",Https://M.Media-Amazon.Com/Images/I/51Dlla8Hnwl._Sx300_Sy300_Ql70_Ml2_.Jpg,Https://Www.Amazon.In/Iqoo-128Gb-Storage-Snapdragon%C2%Ae-Flashcharge/Dp/B07Wdkldrx/Ref=Sr_1_63?Qid=1672895762&S=Electronics&Sr=1-63

I Was Even Mentally Prepared For A Bad Camera, Based On Some Reviews Here. But I Was Pleasantly Surprised That Camera Clicks Good Photos. They Are Not Awesome, But They Are Decent Photos That Can Even Be Shared.Now Coming To My Biggest Grouse; Heating Issue. The Phone Started Heating Up While Charging, But It Was Just A Little And So I Could Have Ignored It. But Then It Started Heating Up More And Got Me Very Concerned. I Even Ordered A Replacement Thinking I Got A Defective Piece. But Then, After Further Tests, I Found That It Is Heating More When I Download Huge Amounts Of Data, For Example, When I Restore Data Of My Old Phone, From Back Up. This Is Ok With Me As, I Don'T Perform Huge Data Loads Regularly, Definitely Not On Phone. Then I Tested By Running Tasks I Usually Perform Such As Checking Office Mails, Attending Office Meeting On Phone, Watching A Video From Amazon Prime, And So On. The Phone Did Not Heat Up Even A Little. Personally, This Is Good For Me.At This Price Range, This Is A Good Phone. But If You Are Camera Heavy User And Expect To Perform Heavy Downloads Frequently, This Phone May Not For You. I Am Personally Satisfied With This Phone As It Works For My Type Of Usage. I Will Not Go Into Plus Points Of This Phone As They Are Covered By Other Reviews Already. I Am Only Attempting To Clarify About How This Phone Can Suit You (Or Not) In Terms Of Camera And Heating. I Had Many Questions About These Aspects Before Buying. Perhaps This Review Will Help You Make An Informed Decision To Buy (Or Avoid).

If The Buds Fit In One'S Ears With A Good Seal, The Sound Is Full Bodied But If The Seal Is Not Perfect, It May Be Tinny.The Sound Signature Is Very Bassy For My Taste And I Have To Eq It To My Taste. The Bass Is So Pounding That Sometimes It Becomes Difficult To Get A Taste Of The Treble. I Listen It In Treble Boost Mode Adjusted Through The App. Anc Works Strangely And Noise Reduction Is Not Very Decipherable. In Contrary, Anc On Somewhat Opens Up The Sound. Don'T Buy This For Anc.Strangely To Me, These Buds Sound Better On My Iphone 12Mini Than My Galaxy S22 (Spotify And Apple Music). The Buds Have App Support For Both Android (Galaxy Wear) And Ios (Galaxy Buds Live) But The Android App Is More Feature Packed And Works Better.  The Ios App Couldn'T Update The Firmware (Although There Is A Menu In The App) And Always Showed The Device To Be On Latest Firmware. However,  As Soon As I Connected With My S22, On Pairing,  The First Thing It Did Was To Update The Firmware.I Love These Buds Solely For Their Form Factor And They Are Pretty Good For 4.4K Against An Mrp Of 16K. The Do Sound Very Good But Does Not Suit My Taste.  Persons Loving Bass May Love Them. Don'T Get Them For Anc. Battery Consumption Not Yet Fully Tested But Seems Ok. It Has Wireless Charging Too. If Your Ears Are Too Small Or Too Large Than Normal - Better Not To Buy As They May Either Not Go In The Ears Or Will Fit Loose Giving A Improper Seal.,Best Call Quality. Noise Cancelling Could Have Been Improved To Best, But Still Wotks Good.Descent Battery Life.Music Is Good. Not To That Top Notch, But Good In This Segment.Overall Worth For Buying With Good Call Quality A Very Little To Compromise But Good.,I Am Using This For Like 3 Months It Is A Good And Productive If You Are In The Samsung Ecosystem If You Are Not A Part Then Do Not Buy It Its Not Worth Its Price.,Bluetooth Range Is Not That Good,The Sound Quality Is Extremely Good For A Tws And The Sound Signature Is Almost Flat. I Got These For Rs.5290, It Almost Felt Like A Steal Deal For Me Until I Faced One Cardinal Flaw In The Design Of These Buds. The Bluetooth Antenna Has An Absymal Performance. It Feels Like I Am Using Bluetooth V3.0. The Range Is So Poor That Even If You Put The Phone In The Pocket, The Audio Starts Stuttering. The Mic Quality Is A Hit Or Miss, Inside The House It Works Very Well, But Outside It Performs Poorly. I Think It Has More To Do With Poor Antenna Design Than The Microphone'S Quality. If You Are Thinking That Maybe The Faulty Product Is An Exception, Then Do A Google Search About Its Range Issue And You Will Find Hundreds Of People Complaining About The Same Thing. Samsung Has Poorly Implemented The Design And Is Reluctant To Admit Its Fault. I Pity Those Who Bought It At Around 15K For Such A Flawed Product. Even At Rs 5K It Is Not Worth It Because Of The Range Issue. It Is Better To Buy A Wired Iem, Atleast It Will Sound Better Than This.,In This Price Samsung Brand Is Goodeasy To Wear And Good Battery Backuphardly Support The 2 Meter Bluetooth Connectivity",Https://M.Media-Amazon.Com/Images/I/31Sx7+Mu+Vl._Sy300_Sx300_.Jpg,Https://Www.Amazon.In/Samsung-Galaxy-Sm-R180Nzkainu-Mystic-Black/Dp/B08Fn6Wgdq/Ref=Sr_1_74?Qid=1672895770&S=Electronics&Sr=1-74

Review 1 Is 30 Days After Purchase (Typos In The Review 1 Has Rectified Now) And Review 2 Is 15 Days Post Android 13 Beta Update. These Reviews Are Based On My Own Personal Experience Of The Device Purchased Here In Amazon On 1 August 2022.Before Oos 13 Update, 5G (Only For Jio) Was Enabled Via Another Update. 5G Is Still Not Available In My Region. Hence, 5G Related Parameters Are Not Covered In This Review.Review 2: After About 15 Days Of Oxygen Os 13 Beta Update (Android 13):(Update Received On 1 Dec 2023).Note: After The Beta Update, No New Issues Popped Up.I.E., There Were;No Heating Related Issues.No Fast Battery Drain.No Change In The Charging Time.No Annoying Bugs.No Change In Camera Performance.Beta Update Is Mostly Like A Stable Update.Oos 13 (Android 13) Update Review:Delighters:> No New Apps Added. Absolutely Not.> System Storage Consumption Remains The Same (13.2 Gb).> Animations Are More Fluidic.> More Customization Ui Features Added. (Scout Widgets In Home Screen, Enlarged Folder & Lot More.)> Daily Data Usage Is Available In The Notification Panel And Need Not Be Reset Daily Unlike Earlier.> Slight Improvement In The Front Ambient Light Sensor.> Ability To Play Videos In The Background & Screen Off As Well (Even For Youtube)  (Really A Welcoming & Longing Feature, Which Other Brand Uis Have Not Or Only With Screen Off)> Stand-By Battery Life Has Improved Substantially.Disappointers:> Brightness At Lowest Level Is Brighter Than Before.> No Improvement In Sound Levels. Still Initial 40% Is Too Silent.> No Dolby Atomos (Which Was Mentioned For Oos 13). Perhaps, To Wait For Stable Update.> Auto Brightness Latency Is Higher Than Earlier. Response Time Is Tad Increased.> Haptics Have Become Tighter Than Earlier, But Still Not Stronger.=======================================================================Review 1:Verdict - A Good Buy In This Price Range In 2022.Note:- This Review Is After A Month'S Usage.- Received 2 Updates During The Course Of Time (Recent Update Was Of 0.98 Gb).- System Consumes 13.2 Gb Space. 128 Gb Variant Is Pretty Adequate For A Normal Usage.- N77 Band Is Missing For 5G.- The Unit I Bought Does Not Have Any Sort Of Heating Issues Or Fast Battery Drain Issue.- Shifting From A 120 Hz To This 90 Hz Mobile. No Noticeable Difference Observed. ( In Non-Gaming Aspect)- Nothing Great Or Noting Worse In The Unmentioned Parameters.Things That Are Delighting;> Exceptional Signal Reception (Especially 4G+ Carrier Aggregation). Very Fast Download Speeds.> Insane Fast Charging (0 To 100% In 40 Mins, 30 To 100 % In 20 Mins, Excluding Trickle Charge). No Heating Of The Mobile (Just Slight Warming) During Charging.> Stand By Charge And Sot Is Fantastic (Even More Than 7.5 Hrs, For Videos, Yt And General Tasks And Calls, Even In Mobile Data Always On And Aod Set To Battery Saver.> Oxygen Os = Color Os/Realme Os - Bloatware.

Parallel Downloads Makes The Area Near The Camera Module Warm).> Though The In-Hand Feel Is Good, The Buttons Are Of No Close Tolerances And Wobbles A Bit.> Data Billing Cycle To Be Reset Daily To Show The Daily Data Usage In The Notification Panel.> The Inbuild Dac (No 3.5 Mm Hole And Only Type-C Port) Is Not Great. The Dirac Equalizer Is Also Not Yielding Best Output. Perhaps, Dolby Atmos Support In Oos 13 Could Improve The Audio Output.,Overall It'S A Good Mobile Phone. The Speed And Interface Is All Good But Expect Battery To Last Long. Not Much, I Always Keep It In Battery Saving Mode And Work For About 18-20 Hours On Normal Use.. Not Many Themes Available. Samsung Is Better In That Sense.. There Are Many Wallpapers And Themes Available. Display Is Clear And Camera Is Also Good!

Wires Are Great Built And Tangle Free. The Audio Jack Is Compatible With Almost All Devices And Its Gold Plated As Well. I Just Didn'T Find The Case. It Was Missing From My Product. Though They Have Given 2 Pairs Of Extra Buds With Different Sizes. Overall It'S A Great Wired In Mic Earphones. Go Ahead And Add To Your Cart. You Won'T Regret It.,So First, Let'S Talk About The External-Bulid Quality Is Awesome 9/10 Even At Such An Affordable Price.Looks-I Have All 3 Colours Of These Earphones And All Colours Looks Coolwire-The Wire Quality Is 9/10. I Have These Earphones From 4 Months And These Haven'T Tangled Since. Also The Rubber Coating And The Inside Braided Wires Gives A Nice  Looking Effect.But 1 Thing I Have Seen Is The Middle Piece Which Have A Mic And Buttons Is 180 Degree Reversed. So, Many Times It'S Difficult To Pick The Right Or Left Earphone Without Seeing. But It Is Mentioned On The Earphones So That Becomes Easy.Now About The Main Part The Internalsthe Sound Quality Is So So Nice. üòäAs You Can See In My Title. Solid 8/10. You Can Listen Any Music Like Lofi Or Peacefull Type And When It'S Time For A Party You Can Listen Rock, Bass Boosted Songs With Such A Adorable Quality Its The True Definition For True Sound And At Cheap Prices.Bass Quality Is Also Good.Perfect For The Ears. And If U Want High Bass, I Tried It With Max Bass It Can Produce And That'S Awesome. But Don'T Listen High Bass For Long. Those Can Hurt Ur Ears Really Bad.But Noice Cancellation Is 4/10.Seems Like There Is No Noice Cancellation. Maybe Its Mentioned For The Mic Not For The Earpiece.Obviously There Are Very High Quality Products Then This Product But Those Will Alteast Cost 2000. But I Will Choose This Product Instead Of A 1500 One Or Less Than 1500 Because This Cost Less Than 500 Or Sometimes Less Than 400(Depends On Sale) But Quality And Services Of These Products Are Not Less Than Of A 2000 Rs Earphone.In Past, 1 Of My Earphone Died But The Coustmer Care Is So Generous, There Services Are So Cool And Quick. So Those Got Replaced Within 3 Days. (It'S 3 Days Because I Forgot The Eslip, If You Mail Them With Everting Ready It Won'T Take More Than 2 Working Days)It'S An Honest Review By Me And I Will Definitely Suggest You To But These. ‚ò∫Ô∏èüôÉEdited:-Their Services Are Slower Now. Don'T Know Why And It Takes Around 1. 5Week To 2 Weeks To Get The Refund. If Something Happens To Ur Earphones.Also Its Been Like 1 Year As Of 1-9-21And I Saw Some Trend With It. My Brother Earphones Stop Producing Sound From One Side Evey 4 Months Or Sobut Mine Earphones Be With Me For 5 Months.It'S Not A Problem Though Cause You Can Mail 'Em Regarding This. This Happened With Me Even With Extra Proper Care Of The Earphone.Still The Best Earphones, You Can Find At This Price Point,Not For High Bass Lovers,Everything Was Ok But As Shown In The Picture That You Will Get A Case Along With Earphones,Which Was Not There Inside It(Only Earphone And Some Earplucks Were There),This Range Very Good Product.If Your Budget Under- 400 Definitely You Can Bye This Product.,Nice Product,Product Is Good But The Accessories Like The Pouch Is Not Provided As Mentioned In The Description In The Second Delivery Also, Despite The Return Of First Delivery Of The Product  For Replacement With Pouch,Product Is Good But Needs To Work On Noise Cancellation",Https://M.Media-Amazon.Com/Images/I/41Enfjiaoal._Sx300_Sy300_Ql70_Ml2_.Jpg,Https://Www.Amazon.In/Boom-Ultima-Headphones-Cancelling-Earphones/Dp/B08D75R3Z1/Ref=Sr_1_77?Qid=1672895770&S=Electronics&Sr=1-77

I Was Even Mentally Prepared For A Bad Camera, Based On Some Reviews Here. But I Was Pleasantly Surprised That Camera Clicks Good Photos. They Are Not Awesome, But They Are Decent Photos That Can Even Be Shared.Now Coming To My Biggest Grouse; Heating Issue. The Phone Started Heating Up While Charging, But It Was Just A Little And So I Could Have Ignored It. But Then It Started Heating Up More And Got Me Very Concerned. I Even Ordered A Replacement Thinking I Got A Defective Piece. But Then, After Further Tests, I Found That It Is Heating More When I Download Huge Amounts Of Data, For Example, When I Restore Data Of My Old Phone, From Back Up. This Is Ok With Me As, I Don'T Perform Huge Data Loads Regularly, Definitely Not On Phone. Then I Tested By Running Tasks I Usually Perform Such As Checking Office Mails, Attending Office Meeting On Phone, Watching A Video From Amazon Prime, And So On. The Phone Did Not Heat Up Even A Little. Personally, This Is Good For Me.At This Price Range, This Is A Good Phone. But If You Are Camera Heavy User And Expect To Perform Heavy Downloads Frequently, This Phone May Not For You. I Am Personally Satisfied With This Phone As It Works For My Type Of Usage. I Will Not Go Into Plus Points Of This Phone As They Are Covered By Other Reviews Already. I Am Only Attempting To Clarify About How This Phone Can Suit You (Or Not) In Terms Of Camera And Heating. I Had Many Questions About These Aspects Before Buying. Perhaps This Review Will Help You Make An Informed Decision To Buy (Or Avoid).

Battery Life Is Good I Used To Charge Once And A Day Can Be Completed By Itm Obviously, I Bought It As It Is One Of The Affordable Option In Terms Of Brand. Love To See Metallic Frames In Coming Phones. Storage Is Tremendous And Speed Is Also Good M Overall A Good Purchase A Phone Can Be Rated 4 Out Of 5.,This Smart Phone Is Good Enough For Daily Normal Use. But Battery Life Is Not Good Enough Though Is Says 5000 Mah. Camera Quality Is Not Good Enough In This Price Segment. Although It'S Oxygen Os, It Is Not Well Optimised. From The Starting There Will Be Some Lagging Issue With Some Apps. Another Bad Thing About This Smart Phone Is Its Form Factor. The Company Taking Around 39K But Giving Just A Plastic Body Which Will Looks Like Below 20K. If Someone Wants To Buy This I Suggest To Buy Another Model Don'T Go For This Model Because Of The Brand. One Good Thing Is Oneplus Promised Three Major Android Update And Four Years Security Update. Another Bad Thing Its Primary Camera Design. One Of The Three Camera Is So Big That It'S Embracing To Say Its Price Is 39K.,I Would Like To Get Directly To The Pros And Conspros.1) Battery - The First And The Best Thing About This Phone Is The Damn Battery Life And How Fast It Charges. It'S Just Amazing And I Have Been Kind Of Spoilt By It Now, I Wont Be Able To Adjust With A Lesser Battery Performance And Charging Anymore!2.  Camera- The Camera Is Amazing And Takes Some Really Amazing Pictures. No Complains.3. Looks - The Phone Looks Really Beautiful. I Got The Forest Green Colour And It Looks Simply Awesome And Is Eye Catching And Premium Looking.Cons1) The Overall Working Of The Phone Is Not As Seamless As It Should Be Provided The Hardware It Boasts Of. Having Said That, The Factor Cannot Be A Purchase Deterrent. It'S Otherwise Quite Smooth2) The Absence Of An Alert Slider Was A Disappointed. I Was Used To It On My 6T3)Volume - Not Too Happy With The Phone Speakers. They Somehow Are Not Up To The Mark.To Sum It Up- Just Go For It If You Have A Tight Budget But Want A Premium Looking, Good Performing Phone. It Packs Too Much For A 43K Phone - Good Battery, Fastest Charging In The Segment, Premium Looks, Good Performance.,Using The Phone After Two Days I Have Noticed Weird Experience With Ui, Tapping On Grey Or Black Areas Screen Flickers To That Portion And According To Service Centre It'S Common Issue Across All Phones And Getting Fixed By Oxygen 13 Update As There Were No Issue With 10Pro.So We Have To Do Nothing But To Wait For Releasing The New Os Update On The 10R And Other Models As Well.Overall Device Working Good So Far I Experienced Average Camera Results,Superb Charging But Not So Extended Battery Life, Touch Sensor And Speakers Are Fine And Performance Is Good In My Day To Day Tasks, Hopefully Ui And Os Updates Will Help To Deliver Best Of This Phone.,Over All Camera üì∏ Is Just Ammazing I Am A Youtuber Purpuse Behind Choosing This Device Is It'S Processer Dimencity 8100Max It'S A Supersaft Max Performence Not Even Capturing While Gaming Also It'S Runs Very Smoothly And It'S My First Premium Smartphone I'M The Uploded Photos20X Zoom Lg Pic And I Have Uploded Night And Day Liting Pics To Comparegood Device From One Plus,Its Speaker Is Not Really Working Well Using It Since 6Months Only Plus It Dosent Comes With A Warrenty Plan It Has To Be Brought Separate Camera Quality Is Also Okay Not Thattt Good Microphone Is Also Been Disturbing A Lot While Talking On The Call Other Side Person Gets A Lot Of Disturbance",Https://M.Media-Amazon.Com/Images/I/41Pq4Gjmwel._Sx300_Sy300_Ql70_Ml2_.Jpg,Https://Www.Amazon.In/Oneplus-Forest-Green-Storage-Supervooc/Dp/B09Wrmnj9G/Ref=Sr_1_79?Qid=1672895770&S=Electronics&Sr=1-79

I Am An Old-Fashioned Mechanical Engineer With A Basic Understanding Of Parameters Like Millimetres, Megapixels And Megabytes ‚Äì But I Think Of A Cellphone As A Utility Item, Not A Status Symbol. Applying A Technocratic Approach, I Would Not Choose A Costlier Option Unless I Get Additional Features Which Suit My Requirements.My Foremost Requirement ‚Äì Which Is Entirely Non-Negotiable ‚Äì Is That My Handset Must Have Provision For Two Sim Cards, Since I Do Not Want To Carry Two Separate Handsets For My Cug And Personal Numbers. My Other Requirements Are Not Difficult To Fulfil: A Phonebook With At Least 2000 Contacts, Basic Net Connectivity, A Basic Camera For Photos And Videos And Scope For Downloading A Few Apps Such As The Ubiquitous Whatsapp And My Favourite Word Games (Which Do Not Need Much Memory Or Processing Capacity). I Would Certainly Appreciate Practical Features Like High Reliability, Software And Security Updates And High Battery Capacity (Sufficient For 24 Hours Or Preferably 48 Hours At My Normal Level Of Usage). Besides, I Would Like To Use A New Handset For At Least Two Years.Apart From Exigencies, I Do Not Intend To Use My Cellphone For Surfing The Internet, Videoconferencing Or Sending E-Mails As I Prefer Using A Desktop Or Laptop For Such Activities.I Am Equally Clear About What I Do Not Need. I Do Not Intend To Use My Cellphone For Watching Movies, Reading Books, Listening To Music Or Creating Fancy Social Media Posts. Nor Do I Want A Device For Taking High Resolution Photos During A Vacation As I Would Prefer To Use A Camera. At The Risk Of Sounding Flippant, I Would Say That I Do Not Want A Device To Unlock My Car Or Count The Strokes In A Game Of Golf ‚Äì Primarily Because I Do Not Own A Car And I Do Not Play Golf!Having Used Smartphones Of Samsung And Motorola Makes Over The Past Few Years, I Vastly Prefer The Former. My Last Phone, Which Gave Me Over 30 Months Of Good Service, Was A Samsung M30. Since That Model Is Obsolete Now, I Focused On Its Upgraded Cousins: M32, M33 And M52. The Last Was Immediately Ruled Out As It Does Not Support Two Sim Cards Along With An Sd Card. After Studying The Relative Specifications Of M32 And M33, I Concluded That The Latter Offers Better Value For Money. Generally, It Is Worth Going For The Higher Memory And Higher Ram Versions As These Parameters Affect The Performance And The Difference In Cost Is Relatively Small. With These Considerations, I Narrowed Down My Choice To M33 With 8Gb Ram And 128Gb Storage (Just Twenty Years Ago, I Was Using A Desktop With 2Gb Memory!)As A Confirmation For My Choice, I Compared The Phone I Had Selected With Oneplus Nord Ce 2 (8Gb Ram, 128Gb Storage) Which My Son Had Recommended. The Specification Of The Samsung Phone Was Found To Be Equivalent Or Superior For The Major Parameters, Except That The Display Screen Technology Was Tft Instead Of Amoled. I Also Watched Some Youtube Videos About These Handsets For A Better Appreciation Of Their Competing Features. The Clinching Factor Was That The Samsung Phone Was Priced Substantially Lower Than The Oneplus Product.As For Body Colour, My First Choice Was Emerald Brown, But I Settled For The Mystique Green Since The Former Was Not Available In My Selected Configuration. I Was Thinking This Would Be Irrelevant Since I Use A Case Which Completely Encloses The Handset, But It Turned Out That The Body Colour Can Be Glimpsed Through The Cutout For The Cameras On The Rear Of The Phone.Despite A Strong Family Resemblance With My Old One (M30), The New Phone (M33) Offers Decidedly Superior Specifications And It Meets My Requirements Perfectly. It Is A Few Millimetres Longer And A Few Grams Heavier Than My Old Phone, But These Differences Are Acceptable To Me. Thanks To The 50Mp Front Camera And 8Mp Selfie Camera, The Quality Of Photos And Videos Is Above My Expectations (See Sample Pic Taken At Night At A Distance Of About 30 Metres From The Stage).  This Phone Offers Two Years Of Android Updates And Four Years Of Security Patch Updates, Which Reduces The Worries On These Fronts. Youtube Reviewers Complain That The M33 Has Plain Looks, It Is Heavy, Its Audio Does Not Offer An ‚ÄòImmersive Listening Experience‚Äô And Its Screen Is Plain Old Tft Instead Of Amoled. I Am Willing To Live With These Perceived Shortcomings, So Long As The M33 Meets My Requirements.I Was Glad To Find That Samsung Has Taken An Environmentally Friendly Step Of Offering Many Models Of Handsets Without Chargers ‚Äì Because Old Chargers, Like Old Handsets, Add To E-Waste. However, It Needs To Be Kept In Mind That New Handsets Require Higher Capacity Chargers. The Recommended Charger For M33 Is 25 Watts, But The Chargers I Had At Home Are Rated At 5 Or 10 Watts.To Cut A Long Story Short, I Ordered A 25-Watt Charger Along With The Phone To Avoid Compromising With The Charging Time. After Using The New Handset For A Couple Of Weeks, I Find That My Phone Is At 60-70% Charge At The End Of The Day, And It Takes 30-40 Minutes For Complete Charging (One Of The Useful Features Of M33 Is That It Shows The Time Remaining For Complete Charging As Soon As It Is Plugged In For Charging). It Turns Out That I Could Have Managed With The Old 10-Watt Charger, Except That It Would Have Taken 60-90 Minutes For Full Charging.I Conclude By Emphasizing That Samsung Galaxy M33 5G Is The Perfect Phone ‚Äì But For My Requirements. A Word Of Advice: If You Are Planning To Buy A New Phone, It Would Be Helpful If You List Out Your Requirements So That You Do Not End Up Paying For Features That You Do Not Intend To Use.,With 5G Connectivity, A 120Hz Display And Solid Performance, The Galaxy M33 5G Is Samsung‚ÄôS Best-Value Smartphone Yet Under 20K Segmentpros¬†Almost Half The Price Of Galaxy A53Exynos 1280 Is A Solid Performerexcellent 120Hz Display With Smooth Experience Across The Boardhuge Performance Uplift Over M32One Ui 4.1 Based On Android 12 Has Tons Of Good Features To Love, None Of The Flagship Grade Features Are Skipped Here (Apart From Dex Mode And Spen Features), Zero Lag Or Stuttering In 120 Hz Mode With Ease Of Use And Seemless Switching Of Apps Without Any Crash Or Reloading¬† Of Apps, Makes Using One Ui Pleasure To Surf Acrossyou Get Features Like A¬†Screen Recorder,¬†Video Call Effects, Game Launcher,¬†Link To Windows,¬†Dual Messenger,¬†Quick Share,¬†Music Share, And Secure Folder, Along With Many Others.

The Least Price I Have Seen Is Rs. 539.Performance Is Almost Good As I Expected.Write Speed Is About 17 To 25 Mbps And Reading Speed Is Around 35 To 45 Mbps.

It Is Sturdy But A Bit On Heavier Side. Can Charge Three Phones At A Time If You Use The Two Usb And Third Type C Port As Well For Charging. The Speed Of Charging Is Alright And Appropriate. The One And Only Drawback I Experienced Is The Weight Of The Power-Bank Itself, Without This Limitation It Could Be Really Amazing Product To Buy.,Bit Heavy But Does It‚ÄôS Job. Takes Tooooooo Much Time To Charge. Whatever Mention In The Description Is Not Correct At All With Regards To The Powerbank Charging.,I Needed An Extra Power Bank With A Larger Capacity.

When I First Received This Power Bank It Came In A Small Box (Approx 12X9X3Cm, Mfg: Aug 2019) With Everything Forced In Congested Space. The Issue I Had In This One Was That It Came With Open Seal & No Poly Wrap Around Product Box As If It Was A Used Product Or Was Tampered In Between. So Was Skeptical About The Authenticity Of The Product And Ordered A Replacement Right Away.‚Üí This One Had Usb C Cable But No Carry Pouch.2. When Replacement Came, It Came In A Poly-Wrapped Bigger Box (22X10X4 Cm, Mfg: Oct 2019) With An Outer Sleeve And Main Box Inside With A Hologram Seal. Maybe Ambrane Changed The Packaging. The Hologram Seal Here Was Intact But Was Also Not Applied Properly To Secure The Opening. Looked Like It Was Applied With An Open Box. So Its Presence Was Useless.‚Üí This One Came With Micro Usb Cable And A Carry Pouch.‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢üëú Carry Pouch‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Üí As Per My Analysis Carry Pouch Comes With The Latest October Lot Which Comes In A Bigger Box And Was Unavailable In Earlier Lot With A Small Box.‚Üí Carry Pouch Size Was Appropriate For Power Bank And I Had No Trouble Inserting Power Bank In It.

For This Thing Only, 10 Days Replacement Policy From Amazon And 1-Year Warranty From Ambrame Is Available.‚ñ∂ If One Can Extend The Budget By A Few Hundred, Mi Power Bank Will Be A Better Option With A Metallic Body & Better Quality Overall. I Have Mi, Honor & Ambrane Power Bank And Their Overall Rating Will Be (From Low To High) Ambrane ‚Üí Honor ‚Üí Mi,I Am Putting Up This Review After 1 Day Of Usage. This Is The Second Power Bank I Have Bought From Ambrane India Overall Third Power Bank For My Family. Before To This I Have Bought Their Pp-30 30000 Mah Model And Also Has Mi 2I 20000 Mah Power Bank Both Were Really Good, Here I Am Putting Together All The Pros And Cons Which I Am Able To Find After 1 Day Of Usage And Also A Little Bit Of Comparison. My Dad Uses Redmi Note 7, My Mom Has Mi A1 And I Am Using Redmi Note 3Pros:-- Dual Input Type C And Micro Usb This Is The Foremost And Primary Reason Of Choosing This Power Bank Over Mi Or Other Brands As You Don'T Need To Carry Two Cables If Your Phone Has Type C Input Which In My Family 2 Out Of 3 Has  The Same- Easy To Carry And Hold As It Is Very Compact Is Size I Must Say In Comparison To Mi Or Ambrane Pp-30- Solid And Sturdy Built- 20000 Mah Capacity With Same Lithium Polymer Batteries These Are Safer Then Lithium Ion Batteries, This I Came To Know While Buying This Product-  ‚Çπ200 Cheaper Price Than Mi- Touch Button At The Top To Know The Power Status (This Is Something Unique)-  It Took Less Than 1 Hour To Charge My Redmi Note 3 From 13% To 100% At 2 Cell Battery Indicator, Which Is Pretty Good And Almost Equivalent To My Wall Charger Best Part Same Time And Charging Speed In Delhi Metro- I Don'T Know Either It Is Pro Or Con, Both Of My Other Power Banks Supports Qualcomm Quick Charge 3.0 Technology While This Power Bank Supports Only Fast Charging At 2.4 Amp, But I Feel This Has Charged My Phone Better And Faster Than Mi Power Bank Itself. I Know A Phone Must Also Supports Quick Charge Technology For Fast Charging But When I Use Quick Charge On My Dad'S Redmi Note 7 (Which Supports Qc 4.0) Either From Mi Power Bank Or Ambrane Pp-30 Power Bank It Kind Of Heats Up The Phone, Also It Fluctuates The Power And Automatically Switches Between Quick Charge And Fast Charging Which Affects Your Battery Life, So It Is Safer To Charge The Phone At Optimum Current At 2.4 Ampcons:-- Very Stuffy Packaging, It Looks Like The Power Bank Has Been Forced Fully Stuffed Inside The Box- It Has Some Adhesive Tape At The Top I Don'T Know Why ? Which, When You Remove It, Puts Scratches On The Top, Be Careful While Removing The Same- No Torch Light, Their Pp-30 Have It- Only Micro Cable Inside The Box,Definitely Heavy But I Knew This. I Will Recommend This, As It Has 2 Slots So We Can Charge Two Phones.,Nice Product,Power Backup Is Good.. But The Usb Cable Provided Is Very Bad. It Stopped Working After Few Months Of Usage,Everything Is Good But The Battery Don‚ÄôT Last That Long When Use For Charging Two Device.",Https://M.Media-Amazon.Com/Images/I/31Rktqkvhol._Sx300_Sy300_Ql70_Ml2_.Jpg,Https://Www.Amazon.In/Ambrane-20000Mah-Lithium-Polymer-Stylo-20K/Dp/B07Rd611Z8/Ref=Sr_1_86?Qid=1672895770&S=Electronics&Sr=1-86

I Was Even Mentally Prepared For A Bad Camera, Based On Some Reviews Here. But I Was Pleasantly Surprised That Camera Clicks Good Photos. They Are Not Awesome, But They Are Decent Photos That Can Even Be Shared.Now Coming To My Biggest Grouse; Heating Issue. The Phone Started Heating Up While Charging, But It Was Just A Little And So I Could Have Ignored It. But Then It Started Heating Up More And Got Me Very Concerned. I Even Ordered A Replacement Thinking I Got A Defective Piece. But Then, After Further Tests, I Found That It Is Heating More When I Download Huge Amounts Of Data, For Example, When I Restore Data Of My Old Phone, From Back Up. This Is Ok With Me As, I Don'T Perform Huge Data Loads Regularly, Definitely Not On Phone. Then I Tested By Running Tasks I Usually Perform Such As Checking Office Mails, Attending Office Meeting On Phone, Watching A Video From Amazon Prime, And So On. The Phone Did Not Heat Up Even A Little. Personally, This Is Good For Me.At This Price Range, This Is A Good Phone. But If You Are Camera Heavy User And Expect To Perform Heavy Downloads Frequently, This Phone May Not For You. I Am Personally Satisfied With This Phone As It Works For My Type Of Usage. I Will Not Go Into Plus Points Of This Phone As They Are Covered By Other Reviews Already. I Am Only Attempting To Clarify About How This Phone Can Suit You (Or Not) In Terms Of Camera And Heating. I Had Many Questions About These Aspects Before Buying. Perhaps This Review Will Help You Make An Informed Decision To Buy (Or Avoid).

Apart From Features, Design And Build Is Another Major Aspect One Should Take Care Of When Buying A Smartwatch. The Boat Has Worked On Its Design This Time Which Brings It To A Premium Side In Terms Of Look. The Design Is Inspired By The Apple Watch 3, But It Cannot Be Compared To That. Obviously, In Every Aspect, Apple Watch 3 Would Be Much Better Than The Boat Xtend Smartwatch. Redmi Watch As Well As Amazfit Bip U Pro Has The Same Shape And Design, But The Build Quality Is Much Premium On This One.Boat Xtend Design And Buildi Personally Don‚ÄôT Like The Color Scheme Of This Boat Xtend Smartwatch. The Black Color Variant Comes With A Golden Color Metallic Frame. I Believe The Gold Color Would Fade Away After Some Time. There Are Three Other Color Variants, Which Also Don‚ÄôT Look Stylish As This One. However, That Is My Personal Opinion On The Color Scheme, So Maybe You Might Find The Color Scheme To Be Good.Boat Xtend Designthe Watch Has 5Atm Water Resistance. It Has Silicon Straps, Which Are Quite Comfortable. The Straps Are Good Quality Straps Which You Will Find Comfortable With Regular Usage.Displaycoming To The Display, The Watch Has A 42Mm Square Shape Display. What You See On This One Is A Tft Panel. The Screen Has Big Bezels, However, The Good Part Is That The Screen Goes Completely Back When It Is Off, So You Won‚ÄôT Notice The Bezels, And The Screen Quality Won‚ÄôT Feel Cheap At All. It Doesn‚ÄôT Have An Always-On Display, But We Cannot Complain About That. The Watch Offers A Screen On Time Of Up To 20 Seconds And Up To 12 Levels Of Brightness Control.Boat Xtend Display Qualityi Find The Display Quality Of The Boat Xtend Smartwatch To Be Better Than The Previous Smartwatch From Boat.

The Color On This One Is Not Very Saturated, But This Isn‚ÄôT Something That We Can Complain About In This Price Range.Watch Ui And Featuresthe Ui Of This Smartwatch Is Clean And Easy To Use. There Is A Single Button On The Watch Which Works As The Power/Off Button As Well As The Back Button. Moreover, The Display Is A Touchscreen Display That Works Without Any Problem. There Isn‚ÄôT Much Animation On The Bar Menu, And The Navigation Is Simple, So You Won‚ÄôT Find It Difficult To Use. However, The Watch May Lag A Bit. The Company Has Done Cost-Cutting In Terms Of The Processor, That‚ÄôS Why You May Find It To Lag A Bit, But It Is Ok, And Not A Big Deal At The Price Point You Get It.Boat Xtend Uithe Watch Offers All The Basic Fitness Features Such As Daily Activity (Which Includes Total Steps Walked, Calories Burnt, And Time), Heart Rate, Sleep Tracking, Stress Tracking Breath Training, Spo2 Training, Meditation, Find My Phone, And Music Control. Apart From That, There Are 14 Different Support Modes On This Watch. I Tried A Few Of Them, And They Worked Fine. The Watch Notifies You Of The Incoming Calls, Messages Received, And Various Other Notifications In Detail.Boat Xtend Smartwatch Reviewalexa Supportthe Main Highlight Of The Boat Xtend Is The Amazon Alexa Support. The Watch Has An In-Built Microphone, And You Can Access It By Long-Pressing The Back Button. Do Note That You Can Only Do Some Basic Tasks With Alexa On The Watch Like Setting An Alarm, Setting A Timer, And Such. Well, It Is A Good Thing To Have Alexa On A Watch, But You Won‚ÄôT Find It Very Useful. Probably You Will Use It For A Day Or Two Out Of Excitement, And Then You Won‚ÄôT Prefer Using It Because It Only Does Some Basic Tasks. So, Even If Boat Missed This Feature, It Won‚ÄôT Be A Problem.Boat Xtend Alexa Supportwatch Facesthe Next Cool Thing About This Boat Smartwatch Is The Watch Faces You Get On This One. You Get More Than 100 Watch Faces On The Watch, And Probably More Watch Faces Will Be Added To It. Moreover, You Can Also Set A Custom Watch Face As Well.Boat Xtend Watch Facesboat Wave Appyou Will Have To Download The Boat Wave App To Use The Watch. The App Is Available For Both Android As Well As Ios Devices. You Won‚ÄôT Be Seeing Bugs On The App, And It Works Perfectly. I Haven‚ÄôT Noticed Any Problem With Connectivity Like Frequent Disconnection. The Interface Of The Boat Wave Is Clean And Simple. You Will Get All The Fitness-Related Options And All The Watch Settings On The App Itself.Boat Xtend Boat Wave Appaccuracyaccuracy Is One Of The Important Aspects That One Should Take Care Of When Buying A Smartwatch. So Talking About The Accuracy, I Tested Everything On This Watch, From Normal Walking To Running, Sleeping, And Much More, And I Find The Results To Be Accurate.Boat Xtend Accuracy Testcompared To Realme Or Redmi Watch, The Result Was The Same On All Of Them. So, There Is No Problem With The Accuracy. I Don‚ÄôT Find The Results To Be Accurate On Most Of The Budget Fitness Trackers, But Yes, This Smartwatch Is Accurate In Terms Of Fitness Tracking, Sleep Tracking, And Everything It Does.Boat Xtend Accuracycomparing It To The Noise Watch Which We Tried Recently, The Stress Level As Well As The Spo2 Tracking Is Much More Accurate On This One. It Also Has The Option To Track The Menstrual Cycle In Women.Boat Xtend Accuracybatteryyou Get To See A 300Mah Battery On This One, Which The Company Claims To Last 7 Days. However, If You Use Most Of The Features Of The Watch, Then The Battery Will Last About Two And A Half Days. If You Keep The Brightness Low, Then The Battery Will Last About 3-4 Days. I Find The Battery Life To Be A Downside Of The Watch. It Comes With Magnet Hook Charging Support.Final Wordsboat Xtend Smartwatch Is A Decent Smartwatch From The Boat. It Offers All The Basic Fitness Features You Will Find On A Budget Fitness Tracker, A Good Display, Alexa Support, Good Design And Build, And Much More. The Smartwatch At This Price Is Quite Good. Personally, What I Didn‚ÄôT Like About This Smartwatch Is Its Color Scheme. However, If You Like The Color Scheme, Then I Would Recommend You To Go For It. Overall The Watch Is Good With Nothing To Dislike About It Except For The Battery Life. The Battery Life On This One Is Quite Low. The Company Claims It To Have A Battery Life Of 7 Days, But With Regular Usage, It Will Last For 2-3 Days. If You Are Looking For A Good Smartwatch Under Rs.5000, And You Can Adjust With The Battery Life, And You Like The Color Scheme, Then I Would Recommend You To Go For This Smartwatch. It Offers All The Features That Should Be There In A Smartwatch Under Rs.5000.,Pros:1. Premium Build Quality With Matte Finishing- Sturdy Polycarbonate Frame, Good Soft Silicone Straps That R Absolutely Flush With The Body Of The Watch. Attractive, Trendy Colours.2. Heart Rate (Except Heart Rate Spikes In Weight Training), Pedometer(Steps Counter) Are Accurate But Spo2 Is Off By +/- 2% When Compared To Pulse Oximeter Readings. But Most Smart Watches Offer The Same Accuracy. Sleep Tracking Is Accurate Only For Bed Time & Wake Up Time, Duration But Stages Of Sleep Are Inaccurate. Light, Deep Sleep, Waking Detected But No Rem Sleep Detected. Sleep Data From The Watch Synchronises Smoothly With Boat Wave App. Issues Warning Msg If Watch Not Worn On Hand Properly And Does Not Detect Data Of Surfaces.3. Large (1.69""), Clear Bright, Sharp Lcd Ips Display Even In The Sun.4. Touch Not Smooth, Experienced Jitters. Ui Also Lags At Times & After Attaching The Tempered Glass Sometimes Some Functions Require 02-03 Taps To Work. But Acceptable Scrolling Response If Finger Moved Diagonally Instead Of Vertically.5. In App Gps Works Superbly. Excellent Route Tracking On The Map. This Feature Is Not Advertised In Their Description.6. Bluetooth 5.0 Connectivity Is Good If Mobile Is Kept In Close Proximity(7M). The Boat Wave App Must Remain Running In The Background At All Times.7. Definitely Splash Proof Though Did'Nt Take The Risk Of Submerging The Watch.8. All Notifications Are Working, No Problem With Call Alerts Or Sms Msgs Or Social Media App Notifications. No Lags At All Though There Is Provision For A 3 Sec Lag Which Can Be Turned On.9. Alexa Works Superbly But Since There Is No Speaker, Info Is Displayed On The Screen. My Wipro Smart Bulb, Firetv Stick Can Be Controlled Easily Using The Inbuilt Alexa On The Watch. Alexa Can Do Mathematical Calculations, Currency Conversions, Even Foreign Language Translations, Apart From Supplying Info On Anything Under The Sun. But Ofcourse, Alexa Cannot Make Calls. Alexa Can Set Alarm, Timer Also.10. Sedentary Alert, Drinking Water Reminder, Stress Alert, Menstrual Cycle Alert, Alarms, Timers Function Well.11. Boat Wave App Connects Easily & No Lags Observed. Data Syncs Smoothly With Google Fit App. Excellent Health Reports And Motivational Rewards System In The Form Of Badges. But Settings Can Be Changed Only Through The App And The Watch Needs To Be Restarted For The New Settings To Be Effective.12. Training, Sports Modes R Good.13. Guided Breathing Mode Is Also Good.14. Find My Phone Works Well.15. Extremely Stylish, Light Weight & Comfortable For All Day Wear.16. 07 Watch Faces Available In The Device With 04 Preset Which Cannot Be Deleted. The Rest Can Be Changed From The Boat Wave App.Cons:1. Lacks Vibration Intensity Control.2. Lacks Camera Control Shutter. But Can'T Figure Out Its Use As My Handset Accepts Both Voice Commands & Gestures To Click Pics.3. No Quick Reply Messages For Notifications/Call Alerts.4. No Call Acceptance Or Silencing Feature. A Work Around Can Be If Bluetooth Handset Is Connected At The Same Time.5. Spo2 Is Not Accurate And Sometimes Freezes At 97%. But This Is Common In All Smart Watches.6. Battery Does'Nt Last More Than 03 Days If Continuous Hr Measurement Is Turned On. Otherwise Easily Lasts For 7 Days.7. Watch Faces Are Very Childish. Expected Better Quality Designs. Company Can Easily Improve On This In Their Next Update.8. Amazon Prime Only Replacement, No Refund Policy Is Not Good. At Least Colour Change Should Be Allowed Once.9. Music Control Feature Does Not Display The Title Of The Song.10. No Bp Monitoring Or Temperature Monitoring Feature. Smart Watches Usually Do Not Provide Reliable Bp Data.11. No Calling Feature. But It Does'Nt Matter As Most Don'T Want Conversations To Be Public.12. A Bit Large For Narrow Wrists, Band @22 Mm Is A Bit Wide.13. Company Should Provide A Tempered Glass Protector. No Mention Of Protective Glass On The Display Mentioned. Have Attached A Scot Tempered Glass Purchased Separately.14. There Are Actually Only 10 Sports Modes. Boat Has Bloated The List With Indoor-Outdoor Combi Of 4 Sports (Walking, Running, Swimming, Cycling).15. There Is No Light Sensor. Auto Brightness Is Only Time Dependant But Works Well.Was A Wedding Anniversary Gift For My Wife Who Liked It Very Much Even The Colour- The Evergreen, Classic Gold-Black. Overall The Best Smart Watch With Alexa Built In, Available At The Budget Price Point Of Under Rs 3000.

I Was Even Mentally Prepared For A Bad Camera, Based On Some Reviews Here. But I Was Pleasantly Surprised That Camera Clicks Good Photos. They Are Not Awesome, But They Are Decent Photos That Can Even Be Shared.Now Coming To My Biggest Grouse; Heating Issue. The Phone Started Heating Up While Charging, But It Was Just A Little And So I Could Have Ignored It. But Then It Started Heating Up More And Got Me Very Concerned. I Even Ordered A Replacement Thinking I Got A Defective Piece. But Then, After Further Tests, I Found That It Is Heating More When I Download Huge Amounts Of Data, For Example, When I Restore Data Of My Old Phone, From Back Up. This Is Ok With Me As, I Don'T Perform Huge Data Loads Regularly, Definitely Not On Phone. Then I Tested By Running Tasks I Usually Perform Such As Checking Office Mails, Attending Office Meeting On Phone, Watching A Video From Amazon Prime, And So On. The Phone Did Not Heat Up Even A Little. Personally, This Is Good For Me.At This Price Range, This Is A Good Phone. But If You Are Camera Heavy User And Expect To Perform Heavy Downloads Frequently, This Phone May Not For You. I Am Personally Satisfied With This Phone As It Works For My Type Of Usage. I Will Not Go Into Plus Points Of This Phone As They Are Covered By Other Reviews Already. I Am Only Attempting To Clarify About How This Phone Can Suit You (Or Not) In Terms Of Camera And Heating.

But Afraid Of Future Miui Updates.,Don'T Purchase It As Camera Phone üò§,Dependable & It'S Been A Year.,Budget Mobile,Good For Basic Use,Phone Is Nice , But Software Is Not","I Was Looking For A Phone Below 10K. I Am Not A Person Who Believes To Burn Money For Phones. My Requirement Was A Phone That Has Good Network Reception, Good Wifi Reception, A Balanced Software, Good Battery Life, Good Screen That Don'T Strain Eyes, A Good Hardware, 3.5 Mm Headphone Jack, And A Charger. I Don'T Need 5G Network Because 5G Drains Battery A Lot And 5G Spends Too Much Data. I Don'T Watch Movie Or Yt On Mobile Network And I Wonder How Many Does Watch Fhd, 2K, 4K Videos Over Mobile Network. For Downloading Documents, Social Networks, Banking Apps 4G Is More Than Enough.In My Budget I Found All Phones Have 4Gb Ram. Realme Narzo 50 Was 9999/- During Gif And Had All Those Features Along With A Good Processor And Another One Was Redmi Note 11. But I Found That If I Can Extend My Budget A Little More With All Coupons And Bank Offer I Can Get A Redmi Note 11 With 6Gb Ram At 11749/- . 6Gb Ram Is Always Preferred Over 4Gb Ram Because Nobody Knows Whether With Future Updates The Os Would Demand More Ram Or Not, Also The Softwares May Require More Ram As Time Passes Away. So This Was The Only Option I Knew Then Available.Redmi Note 11 Has Amoled Display, I Am Not Bothered With 60Hz, 90Hz,120Hz. I Keep The Refresh Rate At 60Hz And Display Works Without Zero Lag Or Stutter. All My Desktop Screen Has 60Hz Refresh Rate And I Am Happy With Them So Why Do I Need A 90 Hz Screen? I Think This Is All Just Gimmick Marketed By Companies And Online Reviewers. The Display Has Excellent Colour Reproduction Capability And Colours Look Rich. You Can Adjust Colour Temperature To Warm Or Cool But I Think Standard Is Fine For Me. Also You Can Calibrate Display Colours In Settings But I Think You Don'T Need That. Display Size Is 6.43 Inch It Could Have Been Better If It Were 6.7 Inch. I Prefer Big Display Phone. Redmi Note 12 Has That Big Display. A Plastic Screen Protector Is Pre Applied On Screen And I Am Happy With That. The Screen Protector Feels Smooth And Fingerprints Can Be Easily Removed By Wiping With A Damp Cloth. The Screen Has A Punch Hole Camera Which Looks Good.This Phone Duel Speakers. One Is More Powerful At Bottom And Another On Top. But I Think The Second Speaker Is Actually Earpiece Which Amplifies While Watching Movies Or Yt. Bottom Speaker Is Louder Than Top Speaker And Volume Is Good. What More Do You Expect From Such Tiny Speakers!The Phone Has Excellent Wifi And Mobile Network Reception. Many Have Complained About Poor Wifi Connectivity But From My Experience I Can Say My Phone And Wifi Modem Stays At Different Floor, Still I Get Good Signal, And Never Disconnected. Voice Over Mobile Network Sounds Nice And Clear And The Other Party Can Hear You Well And Clear. However Because The Second Speaker Is An Extension Of Earphone Piece The Sound Will Leak If The Other Person Is Shouting Over Phone.The Phone Has 5000Mah Battery And Comes With 33W Charger Which Is A Bonus At This Price Point. The Battery Gives Long Backup. With Good Mobile Network You Can Use It For 3 Days Without Charging Using Basic Features, Like Phone, Sms, Email, Fb, Wa Etc. But I Charge It Regularly And Battery Charge Never Drops Below 70%.The Phone Has Sd680 Processor Which Is More That Enough For Basic Tasks And Performs Well Without Any Lag. The Experience Is Butter Smooth. However The Apps Get Automatically Cleared From Ram Which I Like Because I Don'T Have To Clear Ram Manually. However After Android 12 Update The Ram Hold App For Longer Time But Eventually Cleared. Sd 680 Doesn'T Heat Up And It Is Very Energy Efficient. Because Of That Battery Drains Very Little And 33W Charger Charges Phone Within 30 Mins For My Usage. The Cable Is Usb A To C And Feels Good.This Phone Has Ir Blaster So In Your Home Office You Can Control Ac Or Other Supported Gadgets With This Phone When Remote Is Unavailable.This Phone Has Ddr4X Ram And Ufs 2.2 Storage. The Ram Is 6Gb And Can Be Expanded Additional 1 Gb As Virtual Ram By Occupying Storage. But I Have Disabled That Option From Settings Because It Increases Ssd Life. This Has 2 Sim + Sd Card Slot. Which Is A Great. Both Sim Have Volte And Carrier Aggregation.The Phone Has Beautiful Back And Colour Is Attractive. Some People May Complain About Plastic But Remember Plastic Back Phone Has Better Network Reception Than Metal Or Glass Back Phones. And I Have No Problem With Plastic. I Don'T Think Plastic Back Makes Your Phone Or You Look Cheap. I Am Happy With Plastic Back. The Phone Also Gives A Tpu Cover And The Cover However Yellowing After I Month. This Is Inherent Chemistry Of Tpu, And No One Can Prevent This Chemical Degradation. How Ever Can Be Slowed By Not Exposing It To Sunlight.The Fingerprint Scanner Is Excellent It Works Flawlessly. The Touch Screen Is Excellent Too.However I Dont Like Some Of The Preinstalled Apps. Some Can Be Uninstalled A Few Can'T Especially Mi Pay And Getapps From Mi Store. I Don'T Like Them. However I Like The Pre Installed Security App. There Is No Ad In Notification  And All Can Be Easily Disabled. Camera At Back Is Good And Sufficient For Me However The Front Camera Is Not Good. Does Not Show Pictures Like 8Mp Camera. I Have Added Some Pictures Clicked By Redmi Note 11 Back Camera. Miui Is Fluid And Has Many User Friendliness Like Oneui. Miui Is Now Free Of Bugs And Has An Extremely Polished Version That Will Please The User.So I Give Redmi 11 A Score Of 9.5/10. This Is An Excellent Phone The I Got At 11749/- During Great Indian Festival. I Recommend Anyboy With Basic Usage To Buy This Phone. This Phone Is Not For Gamers Or People Who Watch 2K, $K Videos Or Shoot Such Things. This Is Not Or Those Who Are Crazy For 5G. Otherwise This Phone Will Fulfil Your Every Requirement In This Price Segment.,50 Days Usage...1. Good Battery Life. Bqest For Day-Day Use. 33W Charger Also Good.2. Best Display But Should'Ve 120Hz Instead Of 90.3. Sturdy In-Hand Feel4. Stereo Speaker Is Loud And Crisp(65-35 Split).5. Camera Above Average... But Good Concerning The Price.6. Buggy Ui(Minor) As Expected. But Ui13 All Way Better Than Bloody Miui 12.5.7. 4G Chipset Sd 680, Which Is Fine... 4G+ Always Available.8. Some Minor Issue With Wifi Reception. Don'T Know May Be They Will Fix It Through Ota.*** This Phone Is For People Who Clicks Photos Here & There, Casual Gamer & Binge Watchers Of Web Shows/Movies... ""Not Intended For Heavy Gaming""Not For Pubg, Cod Lovers.,The First Look Of This Starbust Design Is Eye Catchy...No Word To Express Its Design,In Hand Feel And And It'S All Physical Dimension. The Second This Which Impress Me, It'S Battery Backup.....Even You Playing Game Hardly For A Long Time....It Gives You Sufficient Battey Backup And Charging Speed Also 33W, Is Also A Good Deal At This Price. The Third Impressive Factor Is It'S Dual Speaker....I Have An Another Phone Of 40K And The Sound Quality Is Almost Same As It. Media Playback Experience Is Also Enhanced By It'S Amoled Display, Very Colour Charming Display...... Literally The Display Quality Is Unbeatable. The Camera Notch And Dual Speaker Increase The Media Playing Experience. Other Performance Like Gaming Is Also Good At This Price Point. Fingerprint Button Is Also Very Responsive. All Other Things And Features Are Good To The Price Point.Only One Thing Is Very Disappointing Bcoz The Hype Of Its Camera That Company Shows Is Very Up To The Mark And Professional Photography But The Camera Is Lower Grade...Even My Old Redmi Y2 Which I Exchanged With This, Had Better Camera Than This ....So Plz I Request You To All .... Don'T Buy This For Camera....Just Don'T. The Images Are Shown Of Camera Pictures On The Website Is Illustration According To Me......I Don'T Recommend You To Buy This Phone As Your Camera Phone.If You Are Non Camera User Then You Will Surely Go For It.Pros- Design, In-Hand Feel, Battery And Charging, Amoled Display,Dual Speakercons- Cameraüò§üò§,Quite A Smooth Daily Driver Phone. The Overall Experience Has Been Satisfactory, Camera'S Good, Durability Also Seems To Be Good, I'Ve Dropped It Quite A Few Times & The Gorilla Glass 5 Seems To Be Holding Up. 120Hz Feels Great. Charging Speed Is Good Too, Nothing Mind-Blowing Though. Battery Life Is Decent. Lasts Quite A Bit, But Since I Keep It In The 120Hz Mode All The Time, It'S A Little Less For Me. But I Don'T Have Any Problem With Battery Life For Now.,It Does What The Description Says.Camera Quality Not Upto The Mark, Compared To Other Redmi Mobiles. Even A3 Model Clicks Better Pics.Finger Print Sensor Is Same As That Of The Lock  Button. You Need To Press The Lock Button Every Time To Get The Fingerprint Read.Volume Is Good For Both Call And Streaming.Fast Charging But Charger Gets Heated Soon.Battery Back Up Is Good, Unless You Don'T Do Heavy Gaming And All Day Video Sreaming.Dual App And Dual Space Option Is Missing.Light Weight And Good Video Resolution.Overall Good For Learning Students For Online Sessions And Persons With Less Need For Photography & Gaming.,I Bought This For My Dad And It'S Working Good For Him, If You Are Planning To Give It To Your Parents Or Elderly People In Your Family Just Install Third Party Launcher And Hide Unnecessary App Aslo Turn Off Spamming Notification And Lockscreen Ads Overall Good Phone For Elders Or First Time Smartphone User.,Phone Is Good, But I Facing Weird Bugs Due To Software Issues. After That I Manually Installed Latest Global Software Then Working Fine.When I Was Using Indian Firmware, After The Update The Phone Got Into Bootloop Every 10 Sec, But After Manual Installation Its Working Fine",Https://M.Media-Amazon.Com/Images/I/411Yu+N3Ukl._Sy300_Sx300_.Jpg,Https://Www.Amazon.In/Redmi-Storage-Qualcomm%C2%Ae-Snapdragontm-Included/Dp/B09Qs8V5N8/Ref=Sr_1_96?Qid=1672895770&S=Electronics&Sr=1-96

My Budget Was Around 20K Max, And This One Somehow Fit In All Ways. I Had Almost Finalized One Plus Nord Ce, But Changed My Mind At The Last Moment And I Don'T Regret. I'Ve Used Redmi Phones Before So I'M Aware Of The Sturdiness And Value For Money They Offer. Got This For 13K With Close To 6K+ Exchange On My One Year Old Tecno Spark 7 Phone (One Of The Worst Phones I'Ve Ever Used, Refer To My Tecno Spark 7 Review For That). Here'S My Review Of This Phone Based On 2 Months Of Usage:Pros:1. Build Quality Is Good. Finishing And Lookwise It'S Sleek And Quite Comfortable In Hand.2. Back Camera Is Really Good, Better With The Ai Camera. The 108 Mp Gives Good Pictures, Although Not Comparable To Iphone Or Google Pixel Quality, But For The Price Range It'S Not Bad. Portrait Mode Gives Great Pictures In Well Lit Conditions, Decent In Low Light With Night Mode.3. 67W Charger Is Very Efficient. Phone Gets Fully Charged Within 40-45 Mins From Below 10% Battery Levels. Battery Backup Is Decent, With Normal Usage Charge Easily Lasts For One And A Half Day Or More.4. Dolby Atmos Dual Speakers Are Really Good! You Could Be Watching Movies On This And Feel The Surround Sound Through The Speakers. Pretty Loud Too.5. No Lagging And Smooth Touch, Refresh Rate Is Pretty Good.6. Unlike Some Of The Earlier Redmi Phones Or Chinese Phones In General, There Are Negligible Auto Installing Bloatwares. Android 11 Performance So Far Has Been Satisfactory.7. Hasslefree Usage In General, Something That I Struggled With A Lot With My Earlier Techno Spark Phone For Basic Functionalities.Cons:1. Front Camera Could'Ve Been A Lot Better. In Daylight Conditions, Picture Colors Aren'T Vibrant Enough, And In Low Light, Pictures Come Grainy. Dissatisfied With That.2. Amoled Display Isn'T As Good As I Had Expected, Especially Becomes Evident When Light Reflects On The Screen While You'Re Watching Something.Nothing Else Worth Mentioning That I Can Think Of Right Now. May Update This Review If Anything Encountered.For People With 15-20K Budget Looking For A Good Overall Usage Phone Having 5G, This Phone  Is Worth A Shot Along With Nord Ce 2 Lite.,Nice Phone With Good Battery Backup,Fast Charging, Sturdy Body And Good Process Speed...

My Budget Was Around 20K Max, And This One Somehow Fit In All Ways. I Had Almost Finalized One Plus Nord Ce, But Changed My Mind At The Last Moment And I Don'T Regret. I'Ve Used Redmi Phones Before So I'M Aware Of The Sturdiness And Value For Money They Offer. Got This For 13K With Close To 6K+ Exchange On My One Year Old Tecno Spark 7 Phone (One Of The Worst Phones I'Ve Ever Used, Refer To My Tecno Spark 7 Review For That). Here'S My Review Of This Phone Based On 2 Months Of Usage:Pros:1. Build Quality Is Good. Finishing And Lookwise It'S Sleek And Quite Comfortable In Hand.2. Back Camera Is Really Good, Better With The Ai Camera. The 108 Mp Gives Good Pictures, Although Not Comparable To Iphone Or Google Pixel Quality, But For The Price Range It'S Not Bad. Portrait Mode Gives Great Pictures In Well Lit Conditions, Decent In Low Light With Night Mode.3. 67W Charger Is Very Efficient. Phone Gets Fully Charged Within 40-45 Mins From Below 10% Battery Levels. Battery Backup Is Decent, With Normal Usage Charge Easily Lasts For One And A Half Day Or More.4. Dolby Atmos Dual Speakers Are Really Good! You Could Be Watching Movies On This And Feel The Surround Sound Through The Speakers. Pretty Loud Too.5. No Lagging And Smooth Touch, Refresh Rate Is Pretty Good.6. Unlike Some Of The Earlier Redmi Phones Or Chinese Phones In General, There Are Negligible Auto Installing Bloatwares. Android 11 Performance So Far Has Been Satisfactory.7. Hasslefree Usage In General, Something That I Struggled With A Lot With My Earlier Techno Spark Phone For Basic Functionalities.Cons:1. Front Camera Could'Ve Been A Lot Better. In Daylight Conditions, Picture Colors Aren'T Vibrant Enough, And In Low Light, Pictures Come Grainy. Dissatisfied With That.2. Amoled Display Isn'T As Good As I Had Expected, Especially Becomes Evident When Light Reflects On The Screen While You'Re Watching Something.Nothing Else Worth Mentioning That I Can Think Of Right Now. May Update This Review If Anything Encountered.For People With 15-20K Budget Looking For A Good Overall Usage Phone Having 5G, This Phone  Is Worth A Shot Along With Nord Ce 2 Lite.,Nice Phone With Good Battery Backup,Fast Charging, Sturdy Body And Good Process Speed...

I Was Even Mentally Prepared For A Bad Camera, Based On Some Reviews Here. But I Was Pleasantly Surprised That Camera Clicks Good Photos. They Are Not Awesome, But They Are Decent Photos That Can Even Be Shared.Now Coming To My Biggest Grouse; Heating Issue. The Phone Started Heating Up While Charging, But It Was Just A Little And So I Could Have Ignored It. But Then It Started Heating Up More And Got Me Very Concerned. I Even Ordered A Replacement Thinking I Got A Defective Piece. But Then, After Further Tests, I Found That It Is Heating More When I Download Huge Amounts Of Data, For Example, When I Restore Data Of My Old Phone, From Back Up. This Is Ok With Me As, I Don'T Perform Huge Data Loads Regularly, Definitely Not On Phone. Then I Tested By Running Tasks I Usually Perform Such As Checking Office Mails, Attending Office Meeting On Phone, Watching A Video From Amazon Prime, And So On. The Phone Did Not Heat Up Even A Little. Personally, This Is Good For Me.At This Price Range, This Is A Good Phone. But If You Are Camera Heavy User And Expect To Perform Heavy Downloads Frequently, This Phone May Not For You. I Am Personally Satisfied With This Phone As It Works For My Type Of Usage. I Will Not Go Into Plus Points Of This Phone As They Are Covered By Other Reviews Already. I Am Only Attempting To Clarify About How This Phone Can Suit You (Or Not) In Terms Of Camera And Heating. I Had Many Questions About These Aspects Before Buying. Perhaps This Review Will Help You Make An Informed Decision To Buy (Or Avoid).

Biggest Disadvantage Of This Device Is It'S In Box Charger Which Is Only 7.75 Watts (5V, 1.55A) That Takes About 3 Hours For A Decent Charge.,üî• Heating Issues During Use With In 15 Minutes Uses.Touch Screen üì± Issues Some Times It'S Too Great And Some Time U Have To Touch Several Times Even On Samsung Key Pad While Typing.We All Family Are Using Samsung Mobiles But This Time I Worried Of Issues If I Have To Face Same Issues I Have To Change Mobile And Transfer Data It'S Very Irritating Work I Wish To If Any One Of Samsung Is Reading This Review Please Reply Me Through Amazon.üî• 15 ‡§Æ‡§ø‡§®‡§ü ‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç ‡§â‡§™‡§Ø‡•ã‡§ó ‡§ï‡•á ‡§¶‡•å‡§∞‡§æ‡§® ‡§π‡•Ä‡§ü‡§ø‡§Ç‡§ó ‡§ï‡•Ä ‡§∏‡§Æ‡§∏‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ‡•§‡§ü‡§ö ‡§∏‡•ç‡§ï‡•ç‡§∞‡•Ä‡§® üì± ‡§ï‡§≠‡•Ä-‡§ï‡§≠‡•Ä ‡§ú‡§æ‡§∞‡•Ä ‡§ï‡§∞‡§§‡•Ä ‡§π‡•à ‡§Ø‡§π ‡§¨‡§π‡•Å‡§§ ‡§¨‡§¢‡§º‡§ø‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§π‡•à ‡§î‡§∞ ‡§ï‡§≠‡•Ä-‡§ï‡§≠‡•Ä ‡§Ü‡§™‡§ï‡•ã ‡§ü‡§æ‡§á‡§™ ‡§ï‡§∞‡§§‡•á ‡§∏‡§Æ‡§Ø ‡§∏‡•à‡§Æ‡§∏‡§Ç‡§ó ‡§ï‡•Å‡§Ç‡§ú‡•Ä ‡§™‡•à‡§° ‡§™‡§∞ ‡§≠‡•Ä ‡§ï‡§à ‡§¨‡§æ‡§∞ ‡§∏‡•ç‡§™‡§∞‡•ç‡§∂ ‡§ï‡§∞‡§®‡§æ ‡§™‡§°‡§º‡§§‡§æ ‡§π‡•à‡•§‡§π‡§Æ ‡§∏‡§≠‡•Ä ‡§™‡§∞‡§ø‡§µ‡§æ‡§∞ ‡§∏‡•à‡§Æ‡§∏‡§Ç‡§ó ‡§Æ‡•ã‡§¨‡§æ‡§á‡§≤ ‡§ï‡§æ ‡§â‡§™‡§Ø‡•ã‡§ó ‡§ï‡§∞ ‡§∞‡§π‡•á ‡§π‡•à‡§Ç ‡§≤‡•á‡§ï‡§ø‡§® ‡§á‡§∏ ‡§¨‡§æ‡§∞ ‡§Æ‡•à‡§Ç ‡§Æ‡•Å‡§¶‡•ç‡§¶‡•ã‡§Ç ‡§∏‡•á ‡§ö‡§ø‡§Ç‡§§‡§ø‡§§ ‡§π‡•Ç‡§Ç ‡§Ö‡§ó‡§∞ ‡§Æ‡•Å‡§ù‡•á ‡§∏‡§Æ‡§æ‡§® ‡§Æ‡•Å‡§¶‡•ç‡§¶‡•ã‡§Ç ‡§ï‡§æ ‡§∏‡§æ‡§Æ‡§®‡§æ ‡§ï‡§∞‡§®‡§æ ‡§™‡§°‡§º‡§§‡§æ ‡§π‡•à ‡§§‡•ã ‡§Æ‡•Å‡§ù‡•á ‡§Æ‡•ã‡§¨‡§æ‡§á‡§≤ ‡§¨‡§¶‡§≤‡§®‡§æ ‡§π‡•ã‡§ó‡§æ ‡§î‡§∞ ‡§°‡•á‡§ü‡§æ ‡§ü‡•ç‡§∞‡§æ‡§Ç‡§∏‡§´‡§∞ ‡§ï‡§∞‡§®‡§æ ‡§π‡•ã‡§ó‡§æ ‡§Ø‡§π ‡§¨‡§π‡•Å‡§§ ‡§™‡§∞‡•á‡§∂‡§æ‡§® ‡§ï‡§∞‡§®‡•á ‡§µ‡§æ‡§≤‡§æ ‡§ï‡§æ‡§Æ ‡§π‡•à ‡§Ö‡§ó‡§∞ ‡§ï‡•ã‡§à ‡§∏‡•à‡§Æ‡§∏‡§Ç‡§ó ‡§á‡§∏ ‡§∏‡§Æ‡•Ä‡§ï‡•ç‡§∑‡§æ ‡§ï‡•ã ‡§™‡§¢‡§º ‡§∞‡§π‡§æ ‡§π‡•à ‡§§‡•ã ‡§ï‡•É‡§™‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§Æ‡•Å‡§ù‡•á ‡§Ö‡§Æ‡•á‡§ú‡§º‡•Ö‡§® ‡§ï‡•á ‡§Æ‡§æ‡§ß‡•ç‡§Ø‡§Æ ‡§∏‡•á ‡§â‡§§‡•ç‡§§‡§∞ ‡§¶‡•á‡§Ç .,Bought For Mom As She Just Want To Use For Calls.

I Was Even Mentally Prepared For A Bad Camera, Based On Some Reviews Here. But I Was Pleasantly Surprised That Camera Clicks Good Photos. They Are Not Awesome, But They Are Decent Photos That Can Even Be Shared.Now Coming To My Biggest Grouse; Heating Issue. The Phone Started Heating Up While Charging, But It Was Just A Little And So I Could Have Ignored It. But Then It Started Heating Up More And Got Me Very Concerned. I Even Ordered A Replacement Thinking I Got A Defective Piece. But Then, After Further Tests, I Found That It Is Heating More When I Download Huge Amounts Of Data, For Example, When I Restore Data Of My Old Phone, From Back Up. This Is Ok With Me As, I Don'T Perform Huge Data Loads Regularly, Definitely Not On Phone. Then I Tested By Running Tasks I Usually Perform Such As Checking Office Mails, Attending Office Meeting On Phone, Watching A Video From Amazon Prime, And So On. The Phone Did Not Heat Up Even A Little. Personally, This Is Good For Me.At This Price Range, This Is A Good Phone. But If You Are Camera Heavy User And Expect To Perform Heavy Downloads Frequently, This Phone May Not For You. I Am Personally Satisfied With This Phone As It Works For My Type Of Usage. I Will Not Go Into Plus Points Of This Phone As They Are Covered By Other Reviews Already. I Am Only Attempting To Clarify About How This Phone Can Suit You (Or Not) In Terms Of Camera And Heating. I Had Many Questions About These Aspects Before Buying. Perhaps This Review Will Help You Make An Informed Decision To Buy (Or Avoid).

No Words For It'S Outstanding Performance At Price Of  10,500Rs. It Can Even Beat Smartphones Upto 15,000 Rs In Camera Department.Battery : For 45Min ~ 5% Charging Gets Discharged (Used For Quora, Twitter, Pininterest)For 18 Min ~ 5% Discharged(Used For Upto 500Mb Gaming Apps)So, Decent Battery.Remember, Display Being Amoled, Full Hd+ With High Ppi Consumes More Battery.Generally, Battery Stays One And A Half Day, If Used Throughout The Day Without Gaming.Display - Very Colourful, Being Amoled. But, Only Once I Saw Some Colourful Lines Passing Horizontally On Display. But, That Was Only Once. I Hope It Doesn'T Occur Again.Edit : It Happened Because,  I Removed Some Permissions From System Apps. It Never Happened Again.Tip : Try To Keep Brightness Low, Prefer Dark Mode For Screen And Use Dark Themes For Apps To Avoid  Ghosting / Screen Burns In Far Future, In Amoled Display Of All Samsung Mobiles.Heating : I Can Feel Constant Heat While Holding It After Using It For A Longer Period Of Time. But, It'S Not Much.Want To Know How Much Heat I Feel? Well, It Feels The Same Amount Of Heat Which You Generally Feel On Most Budget Phones After Playing Games Or Using Mobiles For Long Time In Low Battery.Performance : No Issue As Others Are Making It Out To Be. You Can Play Many Games, Its Just Not Smooth In Heavy Games. In Daily Usage It Doesn'T Lag.I Have Used Sd 660 Before, This Has Mtk G80 So Near About It Gives The Same Performance As That Of Sd660 Or We Can Even Say, It Gives A Little Better Performance And Is Comparable To Sd 662.I Didn'T Play Heavy Games On This Phone, But I Did Play Games Of About 2Gb On My Previous Phone Which Had Sd660. So, I Think Those Games Will Work Here Without Lag As Well.Tip : Just Because,  Some People Got Defective Piece Doesn'T Mean You Will Too. And If You Do See Any Manufacturing Defect, Then You Can Always Place A Replacement Request Within 7 Days Of Delivery For Defectjve Or Different Product. And For Damaged Product You Have To Place Replacement Request Before 2 Days (Read Return Policy For Smartphones Or Check Screenshot I Uploaded)Now Like My Review, If You Found It Helpful!,Good Smartphone For Daily Use, Good Battery Life, Doesn'T Hang Much.

However My Second Iqoo Z6 Pro Which I Purchased Is Still Running On The Original Software Version And Has Excellent Battery Back Up With Negligible Idle Battery Drain .

But Afraid Of Future Miui Updates.,Don'T Purchase It As Camera Phone üò§,Dependable & It'S Been A Year.,Budget Mobile,Good For Basic Use,Phone Is Nice , But Software Is Not","I Was Looking For A Phone Below 10K. I Am Not A Person Who Believes To Burn Money For Phones. My Requirement Was A Phone That Has Good Network Reception, Good Wifi Reception, A Balanced Software, Good Battery Life, Good Screen That Don'T Strain Eyes, A Good Hardware, 3.5 Mm Headphone Jack, And A Charger. I Don'T Need 5G Network Because 5G Drains Battery A Lot And 5G Spends Too Much Data. I Don'T Watch Movie Or Yt On Mobile Network And I Wonder How Many Does Watch Fhd, 2K, 4K Videos Over Mobile Network. For Downloading Documents, Social Networks, Banking Apps 4G Is More Than Enough.In My Budget I Found All Phones Have 4Gb Ram. Realme Narzo 50 Was 9999/- During Gif And Had All Those Features Along With A Good Processor And Another One Was Redmi Note 11. But I Found That If I Can Extend My Budget A Little More With All Coupons And Bank Offer I Can Get A Redmi Note 11 With 6Gb Ram At 11749/- . 6Gb Ram Is Always Preferred Over 4Gb Ram Because Nobody Knows Whether With Future Updates The Os Would Demand More Ram Or Not, Also The Softwares May Require More Ram As Time Passes Away. So This Was The Only Option I Knew Then Available.Redmi Note 11 Has Amoled Display, I Am Not Bothered With 60Hz, 90Hz,120Hz. I Keep The Refresh Rate At 60Hz And Display Works Without Zero Lag Or Stutter. All My Desktop Screen Has 60Hz Refresh Rate And I Am Happy With Them So Why Do I Need A 90 Hz Screen? I Think This Is All Just Gimmick Marketed By Companies And Online Reviewers. The Display Has Excellent Colour Reproduction Capability And Colours Look Rich. You Can Adjust Colour Temperature To Warm Or Cool But I Think Standard Is Fine For Me. Also You Can Calibrate Display Colours In Settings But I Think You Don'T Need That. Display Size Is 6.43 Inch It Could Have Been Better If It Were 6.7 Inch. I Prefer Big Display Phone. Redmi Note 12 Has That Big Display. A Plastic Screen Protector Is Pre Applied On Screen And I Am Happy With That. The Screen Protector Feels Smooth And Fingerprints Can Be Easily Removed By Wiping With A Damp Cloth. The Screen Has A Punch Hole Camera Which Looks Good.This Phone Duel Speakers. One Is More Powerful At Bottom And Another On Top. But I Think The Second Speaker Is Actually Earpiece Which Amplifies While Watching Movies Or Yt. Bottom Speaker Is Louder Than Top Speaker And Volume Is Good. What More Do You Expect From Such Tiny Speakers!The Phone Has Excellent Wifi And Mobile Network Reception. Many Have Complained About Poor Wifi Connectivity But From My Experience I Can Say My Phone And Wifi Modem Stays At Different Floor, Still I Get Good Signal, And Never Disconnected. Voice Over Mobile Network Sounds Nice And Clear And The Other Party Can Hear You Well And Clear. However Because The Second Speaker Is An Extension Of Earphone Piece The Sound Will Leak If The Other Person Is Shouting Over Phone.The Phone Has 5000Mah Battery And Comes With 33W Charger Which Is A Bonus At This Price Point. The Battery Gives Long Backup. With Good Mobile Network You Can Use It For 3 Days Without Charging Using Basic Features, Like Phone, Sms, Email, Fb, Wa Etc. But I Charge It Regularly And Battery Charge Never Drops Below 70%.The Phone Has Sd680 Processor Which Is More That Enough For Basic Tasks And Performs Well Without Any Lag. The Experience Is Butter Smooth. However The Apps Get Automatically Cleared From Ram Which I Like Because I Don'T Have To Clear Ram Manually. However After Android 12 Update The Ram Hold App For Longer Time But Eventually Cleared. Sd 680 Doesn'T Heat Up And It Is Very Energy Efficient. Because Of That Battery Drains Very Little And 33W Charger Charges Phone Within 30 Mins For My Usage. The Cable Is Usb A To C And Feels Good.This Phone Has Ir Blaster So In Your Home Office You Can Control Ac Or Other Supported Gadgets With This Phone When Remote Is Unavailable.This Phone Has Ddr4X Ram And Ufs 2.2 Storage. The Ram Is 6Gb And Can Be Expanded Additional 1 Gb As Virtual Ram By Occupying Storage. But I Have Disabled That Option From Settings Because It Increases Ssd Life. This Has 2 Sim + Sd Card Slot. Which Is A Great. Both Sim Have Volte And Carrier Aggregation.The Phone Has Beautiful Back And Colour Is Attractive. Some People May Complain About Plastic But Remember Plastic Back Phone Has Better Network Reception Than Metal Or Glass Back Phones. And I Have No Problem With Plastic. I Don'T Think Plastic Back Makes Your Phone Or You Look Cheap. I Am Happy With Plastic Back. The Phone Also Gives A Tpu Cover And The Cover However Yellowing After I Month. This Is Inherent Chemistry Of Tpu, And No One Can Prevent This Chemical Degradation. How Ever Can Be Slowed By Not Exposing It To Sunlight.The Fingerprint Scanner Is Excellent It Works Flawlessly. The Touch Screen Is Excellent Too.However I Dont Like Some Of The Preinstalled Apps. Some Can Be Uninstalled A Few Can'T Especially Mi Pay And Getapps From Mi Store. I Don'T Like Them. However I Like The Pre Installed Security App. There Is No Ad In Notification  And All Can Be Easily Disabled. Camera At Back Is Good And Sufficient For Me However The Front Camera Is Not Good. Does Not Show Pictures Like 8Mp Camera. I Have Added Some Pictures Clicked By Redmi Note 11 Back Camera. Miui Is Fluid And Has Many User Friendliness Like Oneui. Miui Is Now Free Of Bugs And Has An Extremely Polished Version That Will Please The User.So I Give Redmi 11 A Score Of 9.5/10. This Is An Excellent Phone The I Got At 11749/- During Great Indian Festival. I Recommend Anyboy With Basic Usage To Buy This Phone. This Phone Is Not For Gamers Or People Who Watch 2K, $K Videos Or Shoot Such Things. This Is Not Or Those Who Are Crazy For 5G. Otherwise This Phone Will Fulfil Your Every Requirement In This Price Segment.,50 Days Usage...1. Good Battery Life. Bqest For Day-Day Use. 33W Charger Also Good.2. Best Display But Should'Ve 120Hz Instead Of 90.3. Sturdy In-Hand Feel4. Stereo Speaker Is Loud And Crisp(65-35 Split).5. Camera Above Average... But Good Concerning The Price.6. Buggy Ui(Minor) As Expected. But Ui13 All Way Better Than Bloody Miui 12.5.7. 4G Chipset Sd 680, Which Is Fine... 4G+ Always Available.8. Some Minor Issue With Wifi Reception. Don'T Know May Be They Will Fix It Through Ota.*** This Phone Is For People Who Clicks Photos Here & There, Casual Gamer & Binge Watchers Of Web Shows/Movies... ""Not Intended For Heavy Gaming""Not For Pubg, Cod Lovers.,The First Look Of This Starbust Design Is Eye Catchy...No Word To Express Its Design,In Hand Feel And And It'S All Physical Dimension. The Second This Which Impress Me, It'S Battery Backup.....Even You Playing Game Hardly For A Long Time....It Gives You Sufficient Battey Backup And Charging Speed Also 33W, Is Also A Good Deal At This Price. The Third Impressive Factor Is It'S Dual Speaker....I Have An Another Phone Of 40K And The Sound Quality Is Almost Same As It. Media Playback Experience Is Also Enhanced By It'S Amoled Display, Very Colour Charming Display...... Literally The Display Quality Is Unbeatable. The Camera Notch And Dual Speaker Increase The Media Playing Experience. Other Performance Like Gaming Is Also Good At This Price Point. Fingerprint Button Is Also Very Responsive. All Other Things And Features Are Good To The Price Point.Only One Thing Is Very Disappointing Bcoz The Hype Of Its Camera That Company Shows Is Very Up To The Mark And Professional Photography But The Camera Is Lower Grade...Even My Old Redmi Y2 Which I Exchanged With This, Had Better Camera Than This ....So Plz I Request You To All .... Don'T Buy This For Camera....Just Don'T. The Images Are Shown Of Camera Pictures On The Website Is Illustration According To Me......I Don'T Recommend You To Buy This Phone As Your Camera Phone.If You Are Non Camera User Then You Will Surely Go For It.Pros- Design, In-Hand Feel, Battery And Charging, Amoled Display,Dual Speakercons- Cameraüò§üò§,Quite A Smooth Daily Driver Phone. The Overall Experience Has Been Satisfactory, Camera'S Good, Durability Also Seems To Be Good, I'Ve Dropped It Quite A Few Times & The Gorilla Glass 5 Seems To Be Holding Up. 120Hz Feels Great. Charging Speed Is Good Too, Nothing Mind-Blowing Though. Battery Life Is Decent. Lasts Quite A Bit, But Since I Keep It In The 120Hz Mode All The Time, It'S A Little Less For Me. But I Don'T Have Any Problem With Battery Life For Now.,It Does What The Description Says.Camera Quality Not Upto The Mark, Compared To Other Redmi Mobiles. Even A3 Model Clicks Better Pics.Finger Print Sensor Is Same As That Of The Lock  Button. You Need To Press The Lock Button Every Time To Get The Fingerprint Read.Volume Is Good For Both Call And Streaming.Fast Charging But Charger Gets Heated Soon.Battery Back Up Is Good, Unless You Don'T Do Heavy Gaming And All Day Video Sreaming.Dual App And Dual Space Option Is Missing.Light Weight And Good Video Resolution.Overall Good For Learning Students For Online Sessions And Persons With Less Need For Photography & Gaming.,I Bought This For My Dad And It'S Working Good For Him, If You Are Planning To Give It To Your Parents Or Elderly People In Your Family Just Install Third Party Launcher And Hide Unnecessary App Aslo Turn Off Spamming Notification And Lockscreen Ads Overall Good Phone For Elders Or First Time Smartphone User.,Phone Is Good, But I Facing Weird Bugs Due To Software Issues.

Some Things-The Whole Step Tracking Thing, I Bought It Due To That Reason, It Didn'T Basically Satisfy Me To That Level With That, But It Does Count Steps Accurately In The Walking Mode(Activity)Its Got Some Scratches In It.. But Its Not That Noticeable At First Glancethe Backgrounds, I Believe It Could'Ve Been Wayyyy Better If We Could Change 4-5 Backgrounds Of 10, But We Can Only Have 2, 1 Customised And 1 Download From The App(Which Has Limited Options)  The Other Backgrounds Are Just.. Eh..The Looks, I'Ll Give It 9/10, It'S Good Looking Stylish Differenttouch Screen Is Goodthe Sleep Tracking Too Is Kinda Accurate(I Still Haven'T Understood It That Well Lol)Battery Life Is Muah, I Use It Without Bluetooth And It Easily Survives For 6-7 Daysspo2 And Heart Rate, I Just Believe What It Says As I Can'T Check Prove If That'S Correct.The Water Resistance, I Haven'T Used It In Water (Ofc Am Scared) The Calling Feature Works Fine.. Its Got Good Sound Overall Its A Decent Watch And Can Be Used In Day To Day Activities, Am Quite Satisfied With It As My First Smart Watch üòó,I'Ve Used This Product For 4 Days, And I'M Going To Rate The Various Features And Different Aspects Of This Smartwatch Which Could Help The Customers Here -So, Bluetooth Calling (4/5) - The In-Built Mic Of This Watch Is Excellent And The Voice Gets To The Other Side Without Any Disturbance, Watch Connects Smoothly With The Mobile And Don'T Get Disconnected Automatically Until You Do It Yourself Through Watch Or Phone. Only Con Is You Can'T Silent The Incoming Call Which Is Annoying Sometime, Hope They Fix It With An Update.Built Quality And Looks (4.5/5) - Metallic Built Which Looks Premium And Straps Are Also Quite Smooth And Comforting. Best Thing Is, It Also Looks Good Over Skinny Wrists(Poor Me, With 5.6 Inch Wrist). Only Con Is You Can Get Scratches On Display So Protect With It Some Sort Of Screen Guard.Touch Screen (5/5) - It'S Almost Buttery Smooth Without Any Lag Which Is Pretty Impressive For A Smartwatch Under 2K. I Bet You Will Not Get Any Laggy Experience Ever.Accuracy (3.5/5) - Spo2 And Hr Has Fairly Decent Accuracies, It Gives You A Rough Idea Of Your Being, So Its Quite Reasonable For A Watch Under 2K. Count Steps With Decent Accuracy As Well. Sleep Accuracy Is Also Just Acceptable.To Sum Up, You Should Definitely Go For This Watch If You'Ve A Budget, Constrained Under 2000 Rs,,I Recently Purchased The Fire Bolt Phoniex Watch, Which Is Quite Stylish, And The Bluetooth Calling Is Excellent. The Voice Gets To The Other Side Without Any Disturbance.The Build Quality Is Good Over The Wrists, But You Can Get Scratches On The Display, So Protect It With Some Screen Guard. You Should Go For This Watch If You Want A Budget-Friendly Smartwatch Under 2000.,It'S A Good Watch But I Have Faced Two Problems In It The First One Is There Is No Feature Of Raise To Wake And The Second One Is There Is No Option To Silent It When Someone Calls You.....I Think You Should Purchase It If In Future Company Add These Two Features...,I Recently Purchased The Fire Boltt Phoenix Watch, And I Am Very Happy With My Purchase. The Watch Is Quite Stylish, And I Get Compliments Every Time I Wear It. The Watch Is Also Quite Comfortable To Wear, And The Strap Is Adjustable To Fit Any Wrist Size. The Watch Also Has A Great Battery Life, And I Can Go For Days Without Having To Charge It. The Watch Also Has A Number Of Features, Including A Step Counter, Heart Rate Monitor, And Sleep Tracker. All Of These Features Are Very Useful And Make It Easy To Track My Activity And Health. Overall, I Am Very Pleased With My Purchase And Would Highly Recommend The Fire Boltt Phoenix Watch To Anyone Who Is Looking For A Stylish And Functional Watch.,This Watch Is Absolutely Stunning And Great Value For Money. Really Pleased With The Design And Shape Of Watch, Definitely A Must Buy For Every Person .Loved The Colour, Durability And Accuracy Is Super üëç. Just Go For It.,I Liked The Product It Has So Many Features Like Sleep Tracking, Sp02, Heart Rate Measuring, Music Player, Temperature Checker My Only Nitpick Would Be That It Only Have 2 Games And Secondly It Has Good Wallpapers But A Ben 10 Omnitrix Wallpaper Would Give It An Even More Awesome Look",Https://M.Media-Amazon.Com/Images/I/41Vjhoqvhjl._Sx300_Sy300_Ql70_Ml2_.Jpg,Https://Www.Amazon.In/Fire-Boltt-Phoenix-Bluetooth-Calling-Monitoring/Dp/B0B3Rs9Dnf/Ref=Sr_1_214?Qid=1672895806&S=Electronics&Sr=1-214

But Afraid Of Future Miui Updates.,Don'T Purchase It As Camera Phone üò§,Dependable & It'S Been A Year.,Budget Mobile,Good For Basic Use,Phone Is Nice , But Software Is Not","I Was Looking For A Phone Below 10K. I Am Not A Person Who Believes To Burn Money For Phones. My Requirement Was A Phone That Has Good Network Reception, Good Wifi Reception, A Balanced Software, Good Battery Life, Good Screen That Don'T Strain Eyes, A Good Hardware, 3.5 Mm Headphone Jack, And A Charger. I Don'T Need 5G Network Because 5G Drains Battery A Lot And 5G Spends Too Much Data. I Don'T Watch Movie Or Yt On Mobile Network And I Wonder How Many Does Watch Fhd, 2K, 4K Videos Over Mobile Network. For Downloading Documents, Social Networks, Banking Apps 4G Is More Than Enough.In My Budget I Found All Phones Have 4Gb Ram. Realme Narzo 50 Was 9999/- During Gif And Had All Those Features Along With A Good Processor And Another One Was Redmi Note 11. But I Found That If I Can Extend My Budget A Little More With All Coupons And Bank Offer I Can Get A Redmi Note 11 With 6Gb Ram At 11749/- . 6Gb Ram Is Always Preferred Over 4Gb Ram Because Nobody Knows Whether With Future Updates The Os Would Demand More Ram Or Not, Also The Softwares May Require More Ram As Time Passes Away. So This Was The Only Option I Knew Then Available.Redmi Note 11 Has Amoled Display, I Am Not Bothered With 60Hz, 90Hz,120Hz. I Keep The Refresh Rate At 60Hz And Display Works Without Zero Lag Or Stutter. All My Desktop Screen Has 60Hz Refresh Rate And I Am Happy With Them So Why Do I Need A 90 Hz Screen? I Think This Is All Just Gimmick Marketed By Companies And Online Reviewers. The Display Has Excellent Colour Reproduction Capability And Colours Look Rich. You Can Adjust Colour Temperature To Warm Or Cool But I Think Standard Is Fine For Me. Also You Can Calibrate Display Colours In Settings But I Think You Don'T Need That. Display Size Is 6.43 Inch It Could Have Been Better If It Were 6.7 Inch. I Prefer Big Display Phone. Redmi Note 12 Has That Big Display. A Plastic Screen Protector Is Pre Applied On Screen And I Am Happy With That. The Screen Protector Feels Smooth And Fingerprints Can Be Easily Removed By Wiping With A Damp Cloth. The Screen Has A Punch Hole Camera Which Looks Good.This Phone Duel Speakers. One Is More Powerful At Bottom And Another On Top. But I Think The Second Speaker Is Actually Earpiece Which Amplifies While Watching Movies Or Yt. Bottom Speaker Is Louder Than Top Speaker And Volume Is Good. What More Do You Expect From Such Tiny Speakers!The Phone Has Excellent Wifi And Mobile Network Reception. Many Have Complained About Poor Wifi Connectivity But From My Experience I Can Say My Phone And Wifi Modem Stays At Different Floor, Still I Get Good Signal, And Never Disconnected. Voice Over Mobile Network Sounds Nice And Clear And The Other Party Can Hear You Well And Clear. However Because The Second Speaker Is An Extension Of Earphone Piece The Sound Will Leak If The Other Person Is Shouting Over Phone.The Phone Has 5000Mah Battery And Comes With 33W Charger Which Is A Bonus At This Price Point. The Battery Gives Long Backup. With Good Mobile Network You Can Use It For 3 Days Without Charging Using Basic Features, Like Phone, Sms, Email, Fb, Wa Etc. But I Charge It Regularly And Battery Charge Never Drops Below 70%.The Phone Has Sd680 Processor Which Is More That Enough For Basic Tasks And Performs Well Without Any Lag. The Experience Is Butter Smooth. However The Apps Get Automatically Cleared From Ram Which I Like Because I Don'T Have To Clear Ram Manually. However After Android 12 Update The Ram Hold App For Longer Time But Eventually Cleared. Sd 680 Doesn'T Heat Up And It Is Very Energy Efficient. Because Of That Battery Drains Very Little And 33W Charger Charges Phone Within 30 Mins For My Usage. The Cable Is Usb A To C And Feels Good.This Phone Has Ir Blaster So In Your Home Office You Can Control Ac Or Other Supported Gadgets With This Phone When Remote Is Unavailable.This Phone Has Ddr4X Ram And Ufs 2.2 Storage. The Ram Is 6Gb And Can Be Expanded Additional 1 Gb As Virtual Ram By Occupying Storage. But I Have Disabled That Option From Settings Because It Increases Ssd Life. This Has 2 Sim + Sd Card Slot. Which Is A Great. Both Sim Have Volte And Carrier Aggregation.The Phone Has Beautiful Back And Colour Is Attractive. Some People May Complain About Plastic But Remember Plastic Back Phone Has Better Network Reception Than Metal Or Glass Back Phones. And I Have No Problem With Plastic. I Don'T Think Plastic Back Makes Your Phone Or You Look Cheap. I Am Happy With Plastic Back. The Phone Also Gives A Tpu Cover And The Cover However Yellowing After I Month. This Is Inherent Chemistry Of Tpu, And No One Can Prevent This Chemical Degradation. How Ever Can Be Slowed By Not Exposing It To Sunlight.The Fingerprint Scanner Is Excellent It Works Flawlessly. The Touch Screen Is Excellent Too.However I Dont Like Some Of The Preinstalled Apps. Some Can Be Uninstalled A Few Can'T Especially Mi Pay And Getapps From Mi Store. I Don'T Like Them. However I Like The Pre Installed Security App. There Is No Ad In Notification  And All Can Be Easily Disabled. Camera At Back Is Good And Sufficient For Me However The Front Camera Is Not Good. Does Not Show Pictures Like 8Mp Camera. I Have Added Some Pictures Clicked By Redmi Note 11 Back Camera. Miui Is Fluid And Has Many User Friendliness Like Oneui. Miui Is Now Free Of Bugs And Has An Extremely Polished Version That Will Please The User.So I Give Redmi 11 A Score Of 9.5/10. This Is An Excellent Phone The I Got At 11749/- During Great Indian Festival. I Recommend Anyboy With Basic Usage To Buy This Phone. This Phone Is Not For Gamers Or People Who Watch 2K, $K Videos Or Shoot Such Things. This Is Not Or Those Who Are Crazy For 5G. Otherwise This Phone Will Fulfil Your Every Requirement In This Price Segment.,50 Days Usage...1. Good Battery Life. Bqest For Day-Day Use. 33W Charger Also Good.2. Best Display But Should'Ve 120Hz Instead Of 90.3. Sturdy In-Hand Feel4. Stereo Speaker Is Loud And Crisp(65-35 Split).5. Camera Above Average... But Good Concerning The Price.6. Buggy Ui(Minor) As Expected. But Ui13 All Way Better Than Bloody Miui 12.5.7. 4G Chipset Sd 680, Which Is Fine... 4G+ Always Available.8. Some Minor Issue With Wifi Reception. Don'T Know May Be They Will Fix It Through Ota.*** This Phone Is For People Who Clicks Photos Here & There, Casual Gamer & Binge Watchers Of Web Shows/Movies... ""Not Intended For Heavy Gaming""Not For Pubg, Cod Lovers.,The First Look Of This Starbust Design Is Eye Catchy...No Word To Express Its Design,In Hand Feel And And It'S All Physical Dimension. The Second This Which Impress Me, It'S Battery Backup.....Even You Playing Game Hardly For A Long Time....It Gives You Sufficient Battey Backup And Charging Speed Also 33W, Is Also A Good Deal At This Price. The Third Impressive Factor Is It'S Dual Speaker....I Have An Another Phone Of 40K And The Sound Quality Is Almost Same As It. Media Playback Experience Is Also Enhanced By It'S Amoled Display, Very Colour Charming Display...... Literally The Display Quality Is Unbeatable. The Camera Notch And Dual Speaker Increase The Media Playing Experience. Other Performance Like Gaming Is Also Good At This Price Point. Fingerprint Button Is Also Very Responsive. All Other Things And Features Are Good To The Price Point.Only One Thing Is Very Disappointing Bcoz The Hype Of Its Camera That Company Shows Is Very Up To The Mark And Professional Photography But The Camera Is Lower Grade...Even My Old Redmi Y2 Which I Exchanged With This, Had Better Camera Than This ....So Plz I Request You To All .... Don'T Buy This For Camera....Just Don'T. The Images Are Shown Of Camera Pictures On The Website Is Illustration According To Me......I Don'T Recommend You To Buy This Phone As Your Camera Phone.If You Are Non Camera User Then You Will Surely Go For It.Pros- Design, In-Hand Feel, Battery And Charging, Amoled Display,Dual Speakercons- Cameraüò§üò§,Quite A Smooth Daily Driver Phone. The Overall Experience Has Been Satisfactory, Camera'S Good, Durability Also Seems To Be Good, I'Ve Dropped It Quite A Few Times & The Gorilla Glass 5 Seems To Be Holding Up. 120Hz Feels Great. Charging Speed Is Good Too, Nothing Mind-Blowing Though. Battery Life Is Decent. Lasts Quite A Bit, But Since I Keep It In The 120Hz Mode All The Time, It'S A Little Less For Me. But I Don'T Have Any Problem With Battery Life For Now.,It Does What The Description Says.Camera Quality Not Upto The Mark, Compared To Other Redmi Mobiles. Even A3 Model Clicks Better Pics.Finger Print Sensor Is Same As That Of The Lock  Button. You Need To Press The Lock Button Every Time To Get The Fingerprint Read.Volume Is Good For Both Call And Streaming.Fast Charging But Charger Gets Heated Soon.Battery Back Up Is Good, Unless You Don'T Do Heavy Gaming And All Day Video Sreaming.Dual App And Dual Space Option Is Missing.Light Weight And Good Video Resolution.Overall Good For Learning Students For Online Sessions And Persons With Less Need For Photography & Gaming.,I Bought This For My Dad And It'S Working Good For Him, If You Are Planning To Give It To Your Parents Or Elderly People In Your Family Just Install Third Party Launcher And Hide Unnecessary App Aslo Turn Off Spamming Notification And Lockscreen Ads Overall Good Phone For Elders Or First Time Smartphone User.,Phone Is Good, But I Facing Weird Bugs Due To Software Issues.

So Highly Recommend Peeling It Off And Taking Your Chances With The Gorilla Glass Or Just Getting Something Aftermarketoverall Strongly Recommend If You'Re Into A Solidly Built Phone That Focuses On Getting Stuff Done Rather Than Sitting Around And Looking Pretty,Good,If You Buy Phone For Camera Purpose Then Don'T Buy This. But Overall Average Mobile Under This Price. Battery Backup Very Good And Changing Time Apx 40-50 Minutes For 1 To 100%.,Good,It'S A Good Product For Normal Daily Use.Camera Quality Is Not Up To The Mark.Overall A Good Product.",Https://M.Media-Amazon.Com/Images/I/41Sj50Fh9Ol._Sx300_Sy300_Ql70_Ml2_.Jpg,Https://Www.Amazon.In/Redmi-Note-11T-5G-Dimensity/Dp/B09Lhzsmrr/Ref=Sr_1_297?Qid=1672895835&S=Electronics&Sr=1-297

Tremendous Battery Life In Heavy Usage. Super Cool Device. Silky Buttery Experience With Blazing Fast Performance. Good Sound Quality. The Form Factor Is Really Good. I Mean The Screen Is Flat, So It Feels Like A Wide(Not Actually Wide But Feels Like) Phone Also It Is Tall, That'S Why It Really Feels Good At Hand. I Have An Ipad But All The Work Now Can Be Done By Phone So I Am Happy.Didn'T Like It - As I Had Op5T I Loved Oxygen Os, But Now It Feels Like Realme Ui. Camera Is Worst For This Price. Main Sensor Is Good Other Two Are Useless. Company Should Provide A Telephoto Lens In This Price Range. I Had Op5T And Previously Op3T,Both Camera Were Good. Op10T Camera Is Exactly Same As Nord 2T.Conclusion - If You Looking For Speed, Performance, Battery Life, Longevity, Best Of Display, Premium Feel Then Go For It.If You Are Looking For Op Experience Like An Alert Slider, Or A Good Camera Then Please Don'T Choose This. Either U Can Wait For The Next Op Or Go For Other Devices. If You Don'T Bother About Ui Experience(I.E. Oxygen) Then Go For Iqoo9T(Its Far Better In Spec)Go To Gsmarena Compare Op10R And Op10T. Exactly Same Specification Except Processor And Charging Speed(This Much Fast Charge Is Not Required By Excluding Important Spec) .,I Am Oneplus User Since Their 1St Phone. I Have Used Oneplus 1 , Oneplus Nord , Nord Ce, Nord 5T And Now 10T. I Have Been Using 10T As My Primary Phone Since Last 1 Month.  Everytime Oneplus Never Fails To Impress With Their New Phone But This Time You Would Feel Something Is Missing May Be Because Oneplus Has Already Raised Their Bar So Much That User Always Expect More From Them . When I Saw 10T First Time , Somewhere In My Subconscious Mind I Had Taken My Decision To Buy This Beast. But Before I Reviewed So May Phones, From One Nord 2 To  Iphone 14.My Ratings :Design And Build: 9/10Camera Quality: 7/10Battery Backup And Charging Time : 9.5/10Performance: 9/10Undoubtedly Design And Build Is Unmatched. So Sturdy And Beautiful. Camera Quality Might Be Discussion Point. They Should Have Given More In Camera Because Phone Comes In High Range And Premium Level But Current Camera Is Not So Bad. Noone Can Beat It'S Battery Charging Time And Backup Time. Within 20 Min 0 To 100% , Highly Impressive. It Will Survive Around 1 Day For Average User. Performance Is Good , Installed And Ran Multiple Apps At A Time, Never Faced Any Hung Issue Or App Carsh Issue.As I Said , Even If Wow Factor Is Missing This Time, I Would Say Good Phone With Nice Overall Performance , Design And Features. If You Get It In Sale Around 40K It'S A Good Deal . Go For It , Nothing To Regret. üòä,Purchased It Some Days Ago !!Switched From My Asus So I Had Really High Expectations And Well, It Did Perform Somewhat Close To It But Also Many Downgrades As Well, I'M Just Gonna List As Pros And Cons !Pros : - I Mean Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1, You Can Expect Amazing Performance, Why Not Top Tier Since It'S The Best Processor Android Could Offer? Well Cause I Feel The Processor On This One Is Under Clocked To Reduce Heating But It'S Holding Up Pretty Good In Terms Of Gaming And Other Benchmark Tests And Stuff.- Build Quality Is Actually Good, Especially The Back, The Back Does Feel Amazing And While Holding It Does Feel Like A Premium Phone, Expect For The Frame Ofc, It'S Made Of Polycarbonate But We Can Get A Hang To It Later.- Software, I'M Not Gonna Sit Around And Cry About Their Merging With Oppo, I Feel It'S Fast And A Good Ui, Of Course Some Old Features Not Available Now Since I'Ve Used A Oneplus 5 In The Past For Some Weeks But We Can Get A Hang To This New Oxygen Os, Just Hope It'S Not Completely Turned To Color Os.- Charging Is Just Insanity On This One, Switching From A Phone Which Used To Take Around 2 Hours To Get Fully Charged To This One, Almost Finishing Full Charge Under 20 Minutes And I'Ve Witnessed It Several Times, It'S Just Impressive But Some Issues And I'Ll Talk About It In Cons.- Networking And Connecting Is Fast And Good! Haven'T Faced Any Major Issues In My Networking Experiences! Calling Is A Good Experience, Connecting With Networks And Bluetooth Is Extremely Fast, Good Overall.Cons :- About The Processor, Like I Said It Is Under Clocked And The Benchmark Scores Proved It A Bit, Although I Don'T Care About Benchmark Scores And Just Want To Keep My Belief In Real Life Usage So It Is Doing Good.- Polycarbonate Frame And No Alert Slider? Like Really? At Least We Deserved A Metal Frame At This Price Segment Which Is What Upset Me A Bit, Not Really A Big Fan Of Alert Slider So I Didn'T Mind That Part.- The Camera Setup Is So So So Average And Stupid, Aside From The Main Lens, The Wide And Macro Just Did Not Make Sense At All And Are Completely Worthless In This Segment, This Is Literally The Same Setup From Nord 2T But Just A Better Software Optimisation, Front Camera Is Alright Too, Nothing That Great- Charging Indeed Is One Of The Key Factors In This Phone But It Takes A Toll On The Battery Backup, Usually In My Usage I Have To Charge It 2 Times For It To Be Used The Whole Day, It Drains A Bit More Than I Expected It To, Also There'S No Option Available To Disable 150W Charging To Let It Charge In Usual Speed To Test The Battery, Only Except For The Night Optimisation Mode, Which Is Kind Of Good In My Opinion.Phone Is A Good Segment In This Price Range And If You Do Believe In The Particular Brand Image And It'S Products Then Go For It. Although Iqoo 9T Does Provide A Better Camera Setup With A Bit More Aggressive Processor Performance, But This Device Does The Job Too.,So , Basically I Am Reviewing It After Usage Of 1 Month And 2 Days. I Am Giving It 4 Star Because Of Alert Slider Missing. Let'S Me Clear It By Points.1. Battery Is Awesome. It Will Get Full Charge In 19 Minutes 20 Seconds. It Lasts More Than 25 Hours To Me.2. Camera Quality Is Nice. Specially Night Mode Is Awesome. Some Improvements Should Be Done For Selfie Camera But It Clicks Nice Picture.3. No Lagging , No Hang. It Runs Smoothly And Very Fast.4. Only Thing That Disappoints Is Alert Slider That Is Missing In This Phone.5. Video Quality Is Awesome While You Record And It Is Stable.6. While Watching Any Ott , Streaming Quality Is Awesome. You Can Fully Enjoy It .7. Speaker Of Phone Is Perfect, Even At Lowest Volume You Can Clearly Hear The Voice On Call.",Https://M.Media-Amazon.Com/Images/I/413C3Znflxl._Sx300_Sy300_Ql70_Ml2_.Jpg,Https://Www.Amazon.In/Oneplus-Moonstone-Black-128Gb-Storage/Dp/B0B5V47Vk4/Ref=Sr_1_300?Qid=1672895835&S=Electronics&Sr=1-300

The Sliding Function Is Very Smooth, But Be Sure To Push Only The Slider Part And Not The Whole Static Part As It Will Make The Grip Weak Over Time Of Usage.The Device Can Be Used With Any Phone And Monitor As They Have No Issue With Opening And Closing The Lids.Now, For The ""Mac Laptop '' Users, It Is Not A Product For Your¬†Laptop, And Never Try This Product For Your Mac Laptops. As The Mac Laptops Have A Stunning Plain Glass Screen That Is Covering The Whole Screen Frame Part And Has No Spacers, That Is There'S No Space Left After Closing The Laptop Lid And Hence Upon Installation Of This¬†Product Will Damage (Crack/Break) The Plain Glass Screen.Installation Is Easy, Remove The Blue Tape And Carefully Stick The Cover As A Sticker, Using The Scale For Support, Or Else You Could Stick It A Little Inclined. After Sticking, Rub Your Palm For Heat Generation And Grab The Screen Frame From Both Palms And Apply The Ultra-Light Pressure And Hold The Position Up To A Good 2 To 5 Minutes. And There You Go For Your Satisfied Invisible Life.*Important - Even If Not In Use, Slide It 2-5 Times Once A Week And Clean It As Per Your Device Cleaning Schedule To Avoid Jamming Due To Debris Or Dust.Overall, It Is A Good Product. For Me, It Has Worked Awesome. Green Signal From Here.Thank You :)Suggestionsto The Manufacturer - Notice The Static Frame Of The Webcam¬†Cover, And Make Its Edges (The Edges Close To The Slider) Smooth (Rounding Off Or Fillet), So That Upon Sliding The Slider With A Fat Finger, It Can Easily¬†Slide Over The Edges Of The Static Frame Hence Do Not Put An Unnecessary Force On A Static Frame.To The Seller - Well Packagingto The Consumer - Check For The Rubber Spacers/Buffers Provided In The Laptop (Like Windows Laptops), If It Is Then You Can Use The Webcam Cover, If Not (Like Mac Laptops), It'S Not The Product For You. Even For Windows Laptops, After Installing A Webcam Cover, Try Not To Put Pressure On The Webcam Cover Location For Long. Slide It 2-5 Times Once A Week To Avoid Jamming.Disclaimerthe Review(S) And Rating(S) Has(Ve) Been Made Upon Personal Usage(S) / Experiment(S) / Experience(S) / Perspective(S) For Specific Product(S) Acquired / Delivered.,I Usually Don'T Trust My Webcam So I Thought Of Giving This Product A Try. It Was Delivered Within 3 Days After Placing The Order. I Received It On 12Th June. First Impressions Were Really Good. I Always Had A Fear That It Would Crack My Screen When I Close My Laptop Lid After Reading The Reviews But It'S Been 3.5 Months And There'S Not Even A Single Crack In My Screen.ùóïùòÇùó∂ùóπùó± ùó§ùòÇùóÆùóπùó∂ùòÅùòÜ ùü∞.ùü±/ùü±You Will Get 3 Webcams Covers In The Package. It'S Extremely Thin. So, It Won'T Cause Any Issues When You Close The Laptop(Hp Pavilion Gaming Used Here) But It Might Cause Issues In The Case Of Laptops With Thin Screens Like Macbook Air, Asus Tuf, Asus Rog While Closing The Lid Due To The Pressure On The Screen. At The End It'S Your Choice.ùóîùó±ùóµùó≤ùòÄùó∂ùóºùóª ùüØ/ùü±I Am Sorry To Say That The Adhesion Of This Product Is Quite Weak. It Literally Falls Off After A Week Of Applying It. I Had To Throw 2 Of It As It Became Useless. I Only Had The Last Piece Remaining.ùó¶ùóºùóπùòÇùòÅùó∂ùóºùóª ùó≥ùóºùóø ùóîùó±ùóµùó≤ùòÄùó∂ùóºùóª : Eventually I Was Able To Find A Solution For This Problem.‚Ä¢ Remove The Stock Adhesion By Gently Applying Isopropyl Alcohol.‚Ä¢ Then Apply A Strong Adhesive Glue (I Used Fevi Kwick). Apply It Only On The Back Edges Of The Webcam  Cover. Since It'S Extremely Thin, I Used Thin Needle To Apply Super Glue Gently On It Or Else The Superglue  Will Spill Out And Make A Mess.‚Ä¢ Immediately You Have To Place It On The Webcam Of Our Laptop. And Then You'Re Good To Go.Its Been 3 Months After Using The Super Glue Technique. Forget About About Falling, It Has Not Even Moved A Bit. No Effect On The Quality Of My Webcam. The Cover Won'T Interfere When You Are Using Your Webcam In Meetings. And Fully Covers It When You Want Privacy. Overall, Its A Good Product Except For The Fact That It Has Poor Adhesion.,Good Product,I Wish I Had Known This Before Ordering. Luckily A Friend Made Me Aware The Very Same Day I Had Applied It.Apple Urges People Not To Close Their Macbook, Macbook Air Or Macbook Pro, While Such Camera Covers Are Applied Because It Can Lead To Cracks In The Screen When Closing Your Macbook!!! It May Also Affect The Ambience Light Sensor, But That Is The Lesser Issue As Compared To A Potentially Cracked Screen And High Repair Costs.Macbooks Are Designed In A Way That When Closing No Foreign Object Thicker Than An Average Printer Paper (0.1Mm) Should Ever Be Between The Screen And The Body Of The Laptop. This Item Is 0.027Inches Thick, That Is 0.6Mm, Six Times The Recommended Thickness!!!If You Are Going To Use It On Your Macbook, Be Sure To Completely Remove It Before Closing Your Laptop. You Can Use It Without Worry On Imac As It'S A Desktop And Doesn'T Get Closed. You Can Also Use It With Any Normal Laptop Where The Camera Isn'T Embedded Inside The Glass Screen. If You Have A Laptop Where The Camera Is Embedded In The Plastic Frame Around The Screen It Should Be Okay.For Disappointed Macbook Users Like Me There Are Two Options. One Is You Trust Apple, Who Are Saying Their Camera Is Hardwired To The Green Camera Light. According To Them One Cannot Work Without The Other, So Even If Someone Hacks Your Camera, You Will Know It Is On Because The Green Light Will Be Glowing.If You'Re Not Sure About Their Reliability And You Still Want To Cover Your Camera, Use A Piece Of Thin Tape. Apple Does Advice Against Anything Which Could Leave Adhesive Residue On Their Screen, But Frankly, If You Just Clean It With Some Screen Cleanser After Removing, I Don'T See How There Could Be An Issue.Why Am I Still Giving This Product 3 Stars? It Reached In Good Condition, Is Easy To Install And Use, And It Will Still Be Useful To People With Other Laptops Or Desktop Screens With Inbuilt Camera. It'S Not A Bad Product. They Just Need To Stop Advertising It For Macbooks!",Https://M.Media-Amazon.Com/Images/I/41Peqz-Jdsl._Sx300_Sy300_Ql70_Ml2_.Jpg,Https://Www.Amazon.In/Liramark-Webcam-Blocker-Computer-Macbook/Dp/B08Bq947H3/Ref=Sr_1_317?Qid=1672895842&S=Electronics&Sr=1-317

It Doesn'T Suck Like The Many Contemporary Feature Phones From Other Brands. That Being Said, It'S Not Great Either With Some Little Annoyance Noticed.Don'T Expect Much As Its A Feature Phone But Then Some Negatives Are:1) There'S A Voice Distortion Noticed Occasionally When Receiving Calls. Have To End The Call & Redo It, Then The Voice Is Clear.Initially Thought It Was An Issue Of A Particular Product. So Returned The Phone & Got A New One.However The New One Also Has This. Have Tried Some Methods To Rectify This Including Switching Off The Volte . Till Now This Issue Has Not Cropped Up Yet Thankfully.2) No Notepad.Come On, How Hard Is It To Give A Notepad On This Phone. If It Can Do Texting & Contact Saving, How Difficult Is It To Give A Notepad To Record Stuffs?3) No Youtube.Since There'S No Dedicated Youtube App, Tried To Access It From The Opera Browser, But To A Big Disappointment, It Can'T Properly Load The Youtube Page, Let Alone Play Any Video.Yes It'S Not A Phone For Constant Youtube Watching. But Since It'S A Very Important Site, Not Only For Entertainment, But Also For Information & News, It Would Have Been Great If Youtube Was Enabled (It Supports 4G, So Why Not Youtube?)4) The Camera Is Very Bad.Can'T Expect Smartphone Standard Camera, But This Vga Camera Is Really Bad. Nokia Could Have Increased The Price About 500 Bucks, & Give An Average 1 Megapixel Camera On It.Sometimes We Take Photos Not For Posting On Social Media, But For Information, Like The Name Of A Store Or Number Of A Vehicle.A Basic Camera That Does That Job Is All That Is Required.5) Was Delighted To See An ""English With Oxford"" App. Assumed They Were Very Thoughtful To Give An Offline Dictionary.But Then Upon Opening, It Turned Out To Be A Demo Version With ""Pay Inr 50"" & ""Play 3 Free Trail""Was Even Disappointed When Upon Clicking The Free Trail Option, It Required Internet & Was Directed To The Opera Website.What'S The Point To This?Other Than This, The Phone Is Not Bad With Some Positive Features Like Wireless Radio, Radio Recording, Big Screen (Compared To Other Feature Phones), Voice Recorder,  Torch, Call Recording Option, Converter App, Stylish Retro Design & A Good Easily Typable Keypad.,,All Os Ok But Battery Life Is Not Good .While We R Not Useing A Single Call Also But Its Draining Battery Life,Good Add-On Phone.

Received A Defective Product. Battery Was Getting Drained Out In Few Hours, Wifi Kept Getting Disconnected And Almost Every App Was Giving Trouble,  Including Google Maps. (Location Was Not Getting Captured)2. Tried To Return It On The 8Th Day Of Purchase After Running Into Issues With Every App I Open. (Tried On 7Th Night As Well, But Phone Froze And Was Not Able To Even Switch Off And Restart The Mobile - Amazon App Was In This Phone. Used Another Phone To Check How To Force Reboot Next Morning And Switched On The Mobile)3. Amazon Said Return Window Is Closed On 7Th Night And Now I Need To Call Samsung Customer Care Directly For Replacement.4. Called Samsung Customer Care And They Tried To Check The Phone Remotely - Couldnt Identify The Issue.5. Informed I Will Have To Visit The Samsung Service Center To Figure Out The Issue6. First Visit To Center, They Did A Software Update (3 Week Old Phone Now - Not Sure What Update Would Be Pending) And Returned The Phone Saying We Will See If Issue Persist For One More Week. They Also Whipped Out The Entire Apps In The Phone.7. Faced Issues The Very Same Evening, Lived With It For One More Day And Went Back Next Morning.8. Second Visit, They Identified That Both Motherboard And Battery Had Manufacturing Defect And Will Have To Be Replaced.9. I Requested For A Phone Replacement And They Told Me Their Policy Doesn'T Allow Them To Replace The Device And Can Only Replace The Mother Board And Battery, Which Was Defective11. They Told Me I Will Have To Contact Samsung Customer Case Number Again If I Want A Product Replacement As They Don'T Have The Authority For That.10. Called Customer Care Number Again, And They Inform Me I Have To Contact Amazon For Product Replacement As Amazon Was The Seller.So Back To Step 3. Will Have To See How Many More Hoops Need To Be Jumped To Reach The End , If I Manage To Reach There.Update :11. All Customer Care Said They Can'T Replace The Phone. So Surrendered To Defeat And Gave The Phone Back To Samsung Customer Care Center For Battery And Mother Board Replacement. They Gave Back The Phone Next Day Saying Parts Are Replaced. Again, Whipped Out Of The Apps Which I Had Downloaded And Logged In Again.12. I Checked The Phone From The Center Itself Before Taking It Back And I Figured The Problem Still Persist (Battery Was Draining Out By The Minute). I Showed It To Them. They Told Me It'S A New Battery And Will Take Some Time To Stabilize. They Also Asked Me To Buy A Super Fast Charger, While I Bought From Them To Not Take Chances. They Asked Me To Check For 2 Days And Confirm. Used For 2 Days. Same Situation. No Improvement.13. Went Back To Them Again. They Checked And Said They Will Forward It To Technical Team For Checking Now.14. Technical Team Checked The Device And Said There Was A Software Issue For Few Products In This Version And Then Will Need A 4 Days To Correct It Since They Are Still Working On The Software Update To Correct This. I Have No Idea How This Product Passed The Quality Test If All These Statements Which They Are Making Are True.15. By This Time Samsung Customer Care Has Used The Phone For More Days Than Me Since Buying The Device And They Have Identified Hardware Issue And Software Issue In The Product, But Still Refuse To Give The Money Back And Take Back The Product Inspite Of Repeated Requests.15. They Kept The Phone For 5 Days And Returned Saying Everything Is Fixed.16. Phone Started Functioning Normally Finally But I Was Sick And Tired Of The Experience.17. I Called The Samsung Corporate Customer Care Narating The The Whole Series Of Event And Asking For Refund. They Refused With All Their Might And Said ""Phone Is Working Now"". During The Process I Also Figured Out That The Customer Care Center Who Kept The Phone For 5 Days For Repair Dint Even Create A Registered Complaint Or A Job Code While Holding The Phone For 5 Days. I Officially Registered A Complaint. But Still No Luck Of Returning The Phone.Update On Nov 30Th.18. I Was Traveling And Outside The Country. On Nov 21St While Using The Phone And With 70% Charge Left Screen Went Off And Stared Showing Grid Lines Like Some Tv From 1980'S. Tried Switching Of The Mobile And Restarting Multiple Times. No Luck. Still Grid Lines. My Flight Bookings, Hotel Bookings And Everything One Can Think Of, Was In The Mobile And My 3 Month Old Phone Is Not Responding To Anything Possible. Friend Thankfully Had A Spare Mobile And I Used That Phone Till I Completed The Trip.19. Reached Back In Town Yesterday And My First Act Is To Visit Samsung Customer Care Center. (Nov 30Th.) Am Writing This Update Sitting At The Customer Care Center. They Mentioned ""Patch Issue. Software Update Dint Happen"" . At This Point, I Know They Are Just Speaking Rubbish To Engage The Customer And Just Delay The Situation. No 3 Month Old Phone'S Screen Will Stop Responding Because Of Software Update Missing. They Are Opening The Phone Again To Operate It, After Again Refusing My Request For Money Refund.,Its Really Good Smartphone In Its Range Packed With Features. And Brand Like Samsung Never Fails To Amuse With What They Deliver At A Given Price Point. I Still Give It A 3.7 Stars As Battery üîã Could Be Better.

Although Their Camera And Software Might Be Better In Some Aspects, The Performance, The Camera And Gaming Features This Phone Offers Is Incredible.Also Pixel And Nothing Phone Dosent Give Charger In The Box So It'S A Plus Point.The Only Issue I Faced Is When I Switch The Phone To 60Hz. It Starts To Act As It Lowers To 30,40 Fps Or Something. And The Battery Life Is Average. It'S 1 Charge In The Evening For Sure. But Decent Battery Coupled With A Fast Charger Is More Than Enough.I Use Nova Launcher With This And This Solves The Home Screen Style.

But Afraid Of Future Miui Updates.,Don'T Purchase It As Camera Phone üò§,Dependable & It'S Been A Year.,Budget Mobile,Good For Basic Use,Phone Is Nice , But Software Is Not","I Was Looking For A Phone Below 10K. I Am Not A Person Who Believes To Burn Money For Phones. My Requirement Was A Phone That Has Good Network Reception, Good Wifi Reception, A Balanced Software, Good Battery Life, Good Screen That Don'T Strain Eyes, A Good Hardware, 3.5 Mm Headphone Jack, And A Charger. I Don'T Need 5G Network Because 5G Drains Battery A Lot And 5G Spends Too Much Data. I Don'T Watch Movie Or Yt On Mobile Network And I Wonder How Many Does Watch Fhd, 2K, 4K Videos Over Mobile Network. For Downloading Documents, Social Networks, Banking Apps 4G Is More Than Enough.In My Budget I Found All Phones Have 4Gb Ram. Realme Narzo 50 Was 9999/- During Gif And Had All Those Features Along With A Good Processor And Another One Was Redmi Note 11. But I Found That If I Can Extend My Budget A Little More With All Coupons And Bank Offer I Can Get A Redmi Note 11 With 6Gb Ram At 11749/- . 6Gb Ram Is Always Preferred Over 4Gb Ram Because Nobody Knows Whether With Future Updates The Os Would Demand More Ram Or Not, Also The Softwares May Require More Ram As Time Passes Away. So This Was The Only Option I Knew Then Available.Redmi Note 11 Has Amoled Display, I Am Not Bothered With 60Hz, 90Hz,120Hz. I Keep The Refresh Rate At 60Hz And Display Works Without Zero Lag Or Stutter. All My Desktop Screen Has 60Hz Refresh Rate And I Am Happy With Them So Why Do I Need A 90 Hz Screen? I Think This Is All Just Gimmick Marketed By Companies And Online Reviewers. The Display Has Excellent Colour Reproduction Capability And Colours Look Rich. You Can Adjust Colour Temperature To Warm Or Cool But I Think Standard Is Fine For Me. Also You Can Calibrate Display Colours In Settings But I Think You Don'T Need That. Display Size Is 6.43 Inch It Could Have Been Better If It Were 6.7 Inch. I Prefer Big Display Phone. Redmi Note 12 Has That Big Display. A Plastic Screen Protector Is Pre Applied On Screen And I Am Happy With That. The Screen Protector Feels Smooth And Fingerprints Can Be Easily Removed By Wiping With A Damp Cloth. The Screen Has A Punch Hole Camera Which Looks Good.This Phone Duel Speakers. One Is More Powerful At Bottom And Another On Top. But I Think The Second Speaker Is Actually Earpiece Which Amplifies While Watching Movies Or Yt. Bottom Speaker Is Louder Than Top Speaker And Volume Is Good. What More Do You Expect From Such Tiny Speakers!The Phone Has Excellent Wifi And Mobile Network Reception. Many Have Complained About Poor Wifi Connectivity But From My Experience I Can Say My Phone And Wifi Modem Stays At Different Floor, Still I Get Good Signal, And Never Disconnected. Voice Over Mobile Network Sounds Nice And Clear And The Other Party Can Hear You Well And Clear. However Because The Second Speaker Is An Extension Of Earphone Piece The Sound Will Leak If The Other Person Is Shouting Over Phone.The Phone Has 5000Mah Battery And Comes With 33W Charger Which Is A Bonus At This Price Point. The Battery Gives Long Backup. With Good Mobile Network You Can Use It For 3 Days Without Charging Using Basic Features, Like Phone, Sms, Email, Fb, Wa Etc. But I Charge It Regularly And Battery Charge Never Drops Below 70%.The Phone Has Sd680 Processor Which Is More That Enough For Basic Tasks And Performs Well Without Any Lag. The Experience Is Butter Smooth. However The Apps Get Automatically Cleared From Ram Which I Like Because I Don'T Have To Clear Ram Manually. However After Android 12 Update The Ram Hold App For Longer Time But Eventually Cleared. Sd 680 Doesn'T Heat Up And It Is Very Energy Efficient. Because Of That Battery Drains Very Little And 33W Charger Charges Phone Within 30 Mins For My Usage. The Cable Is Usb A To C And Feels Good.This Phone Has Ir Blaster So In Your Home Office You Can Control Ac Or Other Supported Gadgets With This Phone When Remote Is Unavailable.This Phone Has Ddr4X Ram And Ufs 2.2 Storage. The Ram Is 6Gb And Can Be Expanded Additional 1 Gb As Virtual Ram By Occupying Storage. But I Have Disabled That Option From Settings Because It Increases Ssd Life. This Has 2 Sim + Sd Card Slot. Which Is A Great. Both Sim Have Volte And Carrier Aggregation.The Phone Has Beautiful Back And Colour Is Attractive. Some People May Complain About Plastic But Remember Plastic Back Phone Has Better Network Reception Than Metal Or Glass Back Phones. And I Have No Problem With Plastic. I Don'T Think Plastic Back Makes Your Phone Or You Look Cheap. I Am Happy With Plastic Back. The Phone Also Gives A Tpu Cover And The Cover However Yellowing After I Month. This Is Inherent Chemistry Of Tpu, And No One Can Prevent This Chemical Degradation. How Ever Can Be Slowed By Not Exposing It To Sunlight.The Fingerprint Scanner Is Excellent It Works Flawlessly. The Touch Screen Is Excellent Too.However I Dont Like Some Of The Preinstalled Apps. Some Can Be Uninstalled A Few Can'T Especially Mi Pay And Getapps From Mi Store. I Don'T Like Them. However I Like The Pre Installed Security App. There Is No Ad In Notification  And All Can Be Easily Disabled. Camera At Back Is Good And Sufficient For Me However The Front Camera Is Not Good. Does Not Show Pictures Like 8Mp Camera. I Have Added Some Pictures Clicked By Redmi Note 11 Back Camera. Miui Is Fluid And Has Many User Friendliness Like Oneui. Miui Is Now Free Of Bugs And Has An Extremely Polished Version That Will Please The User.So I Give Redmi 11 A Score Of 9.5/10. This Is An Excellent Phone The I Got At 11749/- During Great Indian Festival. I Recommend Anyboy With Basic Usage To Buy This Phone. This Phone Is Not For Gamers Or People Who Watch 2K, $K Videos Or Shoot Such Things. This Is Not Or Those Who Are Crazy For 5G. Otherwise This Phone Will Fulfil Your Every Requirement In This Price Segment.,50 Days Usage...1. Good Battery Life. Bqest For Day-Day Use. 33W Charger Also Good.2. Best Display But Should'Ve 120Hz Instead Of 90.3. Sturdy In-Hand Feel4. Stereo Speaker Is Loud And Crisp(65-35 Split).5. Camera Above Average... But Good Concerning The Price.6. Buggy Ui(Minor) As Expected. But Ui13 All Way Better Than Bloody Miui 12.5.7. 4G Chipset Sd 680, Which Is Fine... 4G+ Always Available.8. Some Minor Issue With Wifi Reception. Don'T Know May Be They Will Fix It Through Ota.*** This Phone Is For People Who Clicks Photos Here & There, Casual Gamer & Binge Watchers Of Web Shows/Movies... ""Not Intended For Heavy Gaming""Not For Pubg, Cod Lovers.,The First Look Of This Starbust Design Is Eye Catchy...No Word To Express Its Design,In Hand Feel And And It'S All Physical Dimension. The Second This Which Impress Me, It'S Battery Backup.....Even You Playing Game Hardly For A Long Time....It Gives You Sufficient Battey Backup And Charging Speed Also 33W, Is Also A Good Deal At This Price. The Third Impressive Factor Is It'S Dual Speaker....I Have An Another Phone Of 40K And The Sound Quality Is Almost Same As It. Media Playback Experience Is Also Enhanced By It'S Amoled Display, Very Colour Charming Display...... Literally The Display Quality Is Unbeatable. The Camera Notch And Dual Speaker Increase The Media Playing Experience. Other Performance Like Gaming Is Also Good At This Price Point. Fingerprint Button Is Also Very Responsive. All Other Things And Features Are Good To The Price Point.Only One Thing Is Very Disappointing Bcoz The Hype Of Its Camera That Company Shows Is Very Up To The Mark And Professional Photography But The Camera Is Lower Grade...Even My Old Redmi Y2 Which I Exchanged With This, Had Better Camera Than This ....So Plz I Request You To All .... Don'T Buy This For Camera....Just Don'T. The Images Are Shown Of Camera Pictures On The Website Is Illustration According To Me......I Don'T Recommend You To Buy This Phone As Your Camera Phone.If You Are Non Camera User Then You Will Surely Go For It.Pros- Design, In-Hand Feel, Battery And Charging, Amoled Display,Dual Speakercons- Cameraüò§üò§,Quite A Smooth Daily Driver Phone. The Overall Experience Has Been Satisfactory, Camera'S Good, Durability Also Seems To Be Good, I'Ve Dropped It Quite A Few Times & The Gorilla Glass 5 Seems To Be Holding Up. 120Hz Feels Great. Charging Speed Is Good Too, Nothing Mind-Blowing Though. Battery Life Is Decent. Lasts Quite A Bit, But Since I Keep It In The 120Hz Mode All The Time, It'S A Little Less For Me. But I Don'T Have Any Problem With Battery Life For Now.,It Does What The Description Says.Camera Quality Not Upto The Mark, Compared To Other Redmi Mobiles. Even A3 Model Clicks Better Pics.Finger Print Sensor Is Same As That Of The Lock  Button. You Need To Press The Lock Button Every Time To Get The Fingerprint Read.Volume Is Good For Both Call And Streaming.Fast Charging But Charger Gets Heated Soon.Battery Back Up Is Good, Unless You Don'T Do Heavy Gaming And All Day Video Sreaming.Dual App And Dual Space Option Is Missing.Light Weight And Good Video Resolution.Overall Good For Learning Students For Online Sessions And Persons With Less Need For Photography & Gaming.,I Bought This For My Dad And It'S Working Good For Him, If You Are Planning To Give It To Your Parents Or Elderly People In Your Family Just Install Third Party Launcher And Hide Unnecessary App Aslo Turn Off Spamming Notification And Lockscreen Ads Overall Good Phone For Elders Or First Time Smartphone User.,Phone Is Good, But I Facing Weird Bugs Due To Software Issues.

The Best,Good For The Price.","It'S Been 15 Days Since I Using The Device Extensively.I Bought It On The Last Freedom Sale For Rs. 41,999 ( Including 6K Instant Discount Coupon).First Let Me Be Clear , I Bought ' S20 Fe 5G 'With Snapdragon 865 , Not ' S20 Fe With Exynos ' And I Am A User Who Uses Phone Most Of The Time .This Review May Be Long But It'S Worth To Read It If You'Re Buying This Product.Let Me Divide Between The Pros And Cons.First I Would Like Like To Start With Pros Of The Device ,Pros :1. Display :Samsung Has Been Already Popular For It'S Amoled Displays But I Saw Some Of The Reviewers Wrote About Some Display Issues Here . They Might Have Got Some Defective Piece. I Have No Issues With My Display . It'S Been Long Time I Saw A Great Display Like This ... With 120Hz It Is Super Smooth.Also , It Is Very Bright On Outdoors And Can Decrease It To Very Low While Using At Low Light Conditions ( Ps : No Tint Issues )The In Display Finger Print Scanner Is Very Fast And Didn'T Faced Any Issues With It .2. Stereo Speakers :As An Extensive Multimedia User , This Is One Of The Most Favorable Feature For Me.Believe Me , You Can'T Find Any Other Device With Such Great Sound Quality In This Price Segment , It'S Almost Like Flagship Devices ..Both The Speakers Are Adequately Loud.3. Battery :As A Person Who'S Shifting From A Normal 60Hz Device Phone , I Was Very Worried About The Battery Life Of This Device At 120Hz But It Surprised Me Very Well ..Initially I Thought I Would Need To Switch To 60Hz For Better Battery Life For Daily Usage.But I Didn'T Even Thought This Device Would Give This Much Great Battery Life At 120Hz.At 120Hz , I Am Getting Around 7 Hours Of Minimum Sot ( Screen On Time ).The Maximum Sot I Got At 120Hz Is 9Hours 13 Minutes.I Didn'T Checked Battery Life At 60Hz Because I Didn'T Use It At 60Hz Even A Single Day . The Battery Life Is Excellent.4. Rear Cameras :I Am Not A Very Good Photographer Or Something , I Am Just An Ordinary Person Who Use Camera Occasionally.I Was Very Excited To Use The Telephoto Lens Which Only Can Be Found On Flagship Devices And It Performs Very Well..Added Some Camera Samples Above ( Pic 1 : Ultrawide , Pic 2 : Telephoto [ Pic May Not Be Clear As It Was When Taken Due To Compression Of The Image While Uploading )Both The Three Cameras ( Primary + Ultrawide + Telephoto ) Performs Very Well.If You'Re A Camera Guy You Should Definitely Check This Out.5. Performance & Ram Management :I'M Not A Gamer , I Use My Device For Daily Usage Of Social Media , Ott Platforms , Calls , Messages Etc. But I Use It Extremely.I Didn'T Faced Any Kind Of Heating Issues With The Device Until Now.Also ,Ram Management Of The Device Is Excellent , I Am A Person Who Uses 4-5 Appsbackground At Single Time And I Didn'T Have Any Issues Of Closing Down The Apps .6. One Ui :I Was A Stock Android Guy , But One Ui Actually Surprised Me , It Is Very Well Optimised And Very User-Friendly For Single Hand Usage..Initial Days I Found It Little Hard To Use The Stock Menu Of One Ui But I'M Now Got Used To It.Ps : I Didn'T Found Any Kind Of Ads On My Device As I Didn'T Sign Up Or Used Any Samsung Apps.7. Build Quality :Even Though Its Back Is Made Up Of Plastic , The Overall Build Quality Is Super Premium The Aluminium Frame Gives Us A Feel Like Using A Flagship Device..8. Future Proof :  The Device Has 9 5G Bands , Ip68 Rating , Wireless Charging Which Are Very Hard To Find On Any Device In This Price Bracket.Ip68 & Wireless Charging Are Mostly Only Found On Flagship Devices . Its Good To See Samsung Brings It At Lower Price.This Is The Best Future Proof Device As Of Now.So These Are The Major Pros I Noticed As Of Now .Now Let'S Move To The Cons.Cons :1. No Hdr Support On Netflix :  As An Extensive Multimedia User , I Found It Very Frustrating. Even Mid Range Devices Offering Hdr Support On Netflix , Samsungs Flagship Killer Doesn'T Have Hdr Support.It Will Not Be Fixed Via Ota Update .2. No 256Gb Variant :  This Is Actually Not A Problem For Most Of The People But As A Power User Who Uses Dual Sim , I Found It Little Difficult.But If You'Re A Single Sim User , Luckily It Have Hybrid Solution ..So You Can Use A Sim Card + Expandable Memory Card ...3. Gorilla Glass 3 :  Other Competitors Are Providing Atleast Gg5 In This Price Range. But S20 Fe 5G Has Just Gg3 ( Which Also I'M Not Sure As It Is Not Mentioned Officially Anywhere ).But At The End Of The Day , Glass Is Glass & It Will Broke.4. No Headphone Jack :  It Is Not Any Kind Of Unusual Thing .Most Of The Phones Above 30K Segment Doesn'T Have Headphone Jack.So We Have To Buy 3.5Mm To Type C Adapter , Type C Earphones Or Bluetooth Solutions .Note : Only Buy Original Samsung Type C Adapter Else It May Not Support.5. No 25W Charger :  It Is Not Actually A Con For Me As I Prefer Low Watt Charger Which Is Good For Battery Health And Beneficial For Long Term Usage .But It May Be A Con For You ,  Although The Device Supports 25W Charging . Only 15W Charger Is Provided Inside The Box .. They Should Have Given 25W Inside The Box.I Didn'T Have Any Issues With 15W Charger But It Would Be Great If They Bundle It With 25W As Competitors Are Way Ahead In Terms Of Charging Speed.For The Reference Of Charging Speed ,Both 15W & 25W Will Full Charge The Device Almost At The Same Time But Using 25W You Can Get About 50% Within 30 Minutes Where As 30% With 15W Charger.Full Charge Time I Usually Takes Is 1Hour And 35 Minutes.6. Front Camera :  I Am Not A Selfie Guy , But If You'Re A Person Who'S Looking For A Selfie Device Just Don'T Buy It . It'S Not Like The Front Camera Quality Is Really Bad Or Anything But It'S Not Even Near To The Rear Camera Quality And You Can Find Better Selfie Smartphones In This Price Rangeconclusion :If You'Re A Person Who Wants A Device For Normal Day To Day Usage With Good Battery Life , Great Rear Cameras , Great Performance , Better Software Support , Better Build Quality And Use It For More Than 3 Years & The Cons Mentioned Above Doesn'T Bother Youjust Buy It , I Am Sure You Won'T Be Disappointed.,It'S Been About 15 Days Since I Got This Phone.  I Got It For 29990 On Prime Day Sale. For The Price It'S Good.Pros :1. Camera.  Coming From Poco X2, The Camera Quality On This Is Amazing According To The Price. It Gives You Good Colours, Contrast, Focus, And Everything That You Want. It Has Ois Which Is Very Apparent While Recording. At 4K60 The Stability Is Worse. But Set It To  1080P60 And The Videos Will Be Amazingly Stable. And The Main Advantage Of Ois Other Than Stable Video Is Great Night Mode Shots. Hold The Phone Stable For A While And Along With Ois You Will Get Great Photos With Accurate Colors And Nice Exposure. Attached Samples.2. Display : Absolutely Best. Samsung Displays Are The Best. 120Hz Fhd. Flows Smoothly.  Colors And Calibration Is Top Notch. Brightness Is Good But I Felt It'S A Little Insufficient Under Direct Sunlight. It'S Visible But Could Be Better.3. Oneui : The Main Reason For Upgrading To This Phone Was Software. Oneui4.0 Is The Absolute Best Android Skin Right Now. It Has Way Too Many Customisations In It And Let'S You Personalise Your Phone To A Very High Degree. Like There'S A Feature To Read Out The Name Of The Person Who'S Calling If Your Wearing Headphones. It Took Me 3 Days To Fully Go Through All The Settings And Change Them To My Needs. Also Knoxx Security Is A Special Mention. Knoxx Security Is A Software And Hardware Feature In Samsung Phones Which Protects Your Phone From All Kinds Of Attacks And Keeps Your Data Safe. Even If It Gets Stolen You Can Remotely Delete All Your Data. Secure Folder Allows You To Store Data In A Separate Storage. And Many More Such Good Features. While Being A Very Feature Rich And Storage Heavy Skin, It Still Feels Very Very Smooth And Fast To Use. Unlike Miui Or Other Skins, It Doesn'T Stutter Much And Bugs Are Less.There Are Many Other Small Pros Like Good Stereo Speakers. Nice Premium Build Quality. Good Data And Wifi Speeds. Other Such Features That You Won'T Notice But Definitely Make A Difference In Your Experience.Cons1.  Software.  I Know I Said It'S A Pro But I Say This In The Aspect Of Updates.  This Phone Was Launched In 2021 March In India And Samsung Promises 3 Year Android Version Updates And 1 Additional Year Of Security Updates.  But There'S A Lot Of Confusion Regarding If Or Not This Phone Will Receive Android 14. It Will Receive A13 For Sure. There'S A Lot Of Debate On What They Will Do With14 Because Of Global Version Launch Date Being Earlier And Yada Yada. Basically The Phones Life Maybe 2.5 To 3 Years If They Give A14.  But 1.5 To 2 If Not. I Researched On The Internet A Few People Say That It Will Receive A14 While I Was Few Say It'S Not. It'S Hard To Say Who'S Correct.  So Assume It'S Not Getting A14 If You Are Going For It.2. Battery.  The Battery On This Phone Is 4500Mah And It'S Good Enough For A Days Use. But That'S Because I Use It Lightly. Not Much Online Streaming. No Gaming Light Social Media And Other Usual Stuff. If You Use It Even A Tad Bit More Heavily, You Will Run Out Within A Day. If You'Re Going Outside For The Better Part Of A Day,Like A Day Trip To Somewhere Nearby,It'S Better Keep A Power Bank Handy. In Terms Of Screen On Time Numbers, I Once Got 7 Hours Of Sot On Light Usage, 1 Hr Youtube And 1.5 Hr Streaming. I Was At Home And Used Wifi All The Time.I Got 3 Hrs Sot When I Went Outside For A Day Trip. I Took Many Photos And Videos And The Phone Shutdown Before I Could Reach Home. On A Mixed Use Day,  You Can Get 4.5 To 5.5 Hours Of Sot.Final Verdict : The Life Of The Phone In Terms Of Software Support Is Not Great But You Will Get On Time Updates And Almost No Bugs In The Software. So If You Want To Buy It You Can And Exchange It After Maybe 2 Years For Other Models. But If You Planning On Using It For Longer Than 2 Years,  Better Avoid It. In The Upcoming Diwali And Dussera Sales,  The Price Might Further Drop To 25K Even. I Am Just Speculating But Keep In Mind Your Requirements And Go Accordingly.As Always Amazing Delivery By Amazon.",Https://M.Media-Amazon.Com/Images/I/41Ezrvtwcal._Sx300_Sy300_Ql70_Ml2_.Jpg,Https://Www.Amazon.In/Samsung-Galaxy-Cloud-128Gb-Storage/Dp/B08Vb57558/Ref=Sr_1_434?Qid=1672895879&S=Electronics&Sr=1-434

Even My Voice Is Reaching To Opposite Party Very Clearly While Calling With Watch.# Calculator Features Is Useful# Multi Functional Crown Button Is Easy And Useful .. Easily To Change Theme With Just Scroll The Crown Button# Play Music Directly From The Watch With The Internal Storage Although Its Only 128 Mb But Sufficient To Store Around 10 Songs Approx.. Song Sound Quality Is Also Fine# Strap Quality Is Good And Soft# Tws Connecting Features Is Also Nicecons# Sometimes I Found Watch Is Disconnected With My Phone  ..Not Sure Why Its Happened As I Have Checked Only For One Day# Fingerprints Are Clearly Visible On  Screen Glass .. I Have Attached The Pic For It#Health Tracker Are Near To Accurate But Never Rely On Smartwatch At This Price Range.I Have Measure The Bp With This Watch And With Bp Machine Both Results Are Different... 70-80% Accurate Only..# Ai Voice Assistant Is Not Very Useful As It Only Work For Mobile When I Press The Voice Assistant Button On Watch .. Like If I Give Command To Set Alarm On Watch It Set Alarm On Mobile So Basically It Just A Button To Wake Up Google Assistant For Mobile Phone.#Sometimes When You Pick Call From Your Mobile Phone Call Automatically Transfer To Watch And Voice Started Coming From The Watch Speaker.. Which Is Quite Irritating..This Must Be Correct By Firmware Updates I Have Purchased It For Rs.3420/- Including Bank Offer . For This Price Range Overall Its A Good & Premium Watch ..Its My Experience With This Watch For Just A One Dayrest How It Work For Long Run That Depends..,Recieved A Damaged Device At First... Slight Gap Between Display And Body From The Left Side.. But Quickly Recieved The Replacement Next Day....The Replacement Was Good...Amazon Provided Great Service And Delivered Replacement In Just 16 Hours ...So Great Job Amazon..Also I Live In Bangalore.. So The Experience Might Vary From Place To Place..Prossmooth Enough Uifairly Accurate Readings On All The Sensorsheartrate Bp And Spo2Call Quality Is Great For The Price.. Good Speakers And Good Mic..You Can Control Spotify And Soundcloud Music Too From The Watch .And Use Tws To Listen To Spotify While Controling With The Watch... And It Is Seamless...Display Is Great ..Colors Are Punchy And Bezels Are Good Enough... Not As Narrow As Crossbeats Ignite S4 Max But Still Good Enough...Build Quality Is Good But Does Not Feel Very Premium.. It Does Feel Like A Below 5K Watch...So You Cannot Trick Anyone That This Is A Apple Watch üòÇStrap Is Not Too Long As Every Review Mentions.. Strap Is Good Enough... Not Too Comfy..I Ordered A Metal Strap From Amazon For My Watch And It Is Amazing...Ui Looks Much Better In Person Than Reviews.. Ui Is Smooth And Looks Good... Not As Good As Realme Watch 3 Pro..But Still Good For The Price..Overall Its A Good Watch For The Price Of Around 3.5K -3.9Kanymore And It Is Not Worth The Pricerealme Watch 3Pro Is The Best At Around This Price.. So If You Get That In Stock And For Below 4K Then Get Realme Watch 3 Pro..Or Else For This Price Segment Firebolt Visionary Is The Overall Best Watch Compared To All Other Watches Under 4Kconscall When Recieved On Watch Doesnt Stay On Tws It Switches To Watch For Some Reason..Which Is Onesteps Are A Little Inaccurate And Reads Steps Even If Not Walking..So Dont Rely On Step Counterbattery Life Is Not Great If Youre Using Always On Display And Calling... Maybe Around 3 Daysbut Otherwise Battery Stays For Over 5 Days.Blutooth Range Is Not Too Good.. And Varies From Watch To Watch.. And Also Phone To Phone.. I Get A Decent Bluetooth Range Of Around 20 Ft .. But This Is More Of A Fact Than A Con..,I Write This Review After 1 Week Of Using This Watch, Bp, Bpm, Spo2 Running And Sleep Tracking Functions Are Working Well, Watch Speaker Is Also Loud And Clear To You And The Other Callers. The Only Con Is When You Want To Listen To Songs Through A Watch From A Mobile Its Bluetooth Disconnects Automatically Again And Again, As This Fund Is Not Useful For Me So Ignore It, Overall It'S A Good Watch.,Everything Is Absolutely Greta In This Smartwatch.But These Things Could Have Been Better:. Watch Faces- You Should Have The Option To Add Upto 3-4 Watch Faces At Once From The App Rather Than One At A Time And 10 Pre-Installed Ones. App Ui Could Have Been Better. Dnd Mode Absent. No Option To Toggle Bluetooth (Always On),Before Review I Would Like To Appreciate This Great Strategy To Pour Out Honest Reviews From Users By Giving Them Bookmyshow Voucher.I Loved The Touch Screen Experience & Amoled Screen Of The Watch, It Gives A Feel Of Premium Watch. The Band Of The Watch Is Average & Doesn'T Look Premium & I Separately Ordered A Metal Band. I Am Expecting Mobile App Improvement From Fireboltt As I Don'T Find It Good Enough If I Compare It With Boat'S App For Its Watches (As I Own A Boat Smartwatch). Rest Visionary Is A Good Buy & Worth The Money The Only Thing Which Physically Is Not Appealing Is The Average Quality Of The Band.",Https://M.Media-Amazon.Com/Images/I/41Dtbrnrhdl._Sx300_Sy300_Ql70_Ml2_.Jpg,Https://Www.Amazon.In/Fire-Boltt-Smartwatch-Resolution-Connection-Assistance/Dp/B0B3Ndpcs9/Ref=Sr_1_459?Qid=1672895886&S=Electronics&Sr=1-459

I Was Even Mentally Prepared For A Bad Camera, Based On Some Reviews Here. But I Was Pleasantly Surprised That Camera Clicks Good Photos. They Are Not Awesome, But They Are Decent Photos That Can Even Be Shared.Now Coming To My Biggest Grouse; Heating Issue. The Phone Started Heating Up While Charging, But It Was Just A Little And So I Could Have Ignored It. But Then It Started Heating Up More And Got Me Very Concerned. I Even Ordered A Replacement Thinking I Got A Defective Piece. But Then, After Further Tests, I Found That It Is Heating More When I Download Huge Amounts Of Data, For Example, When I Restore Data Of My Old Phone, From Back Up. This Is Ok With Me As, I Don'T Perform Huge Data Loads Regularly, Definitely Not On Phone. Then I Tested By Running Tasks I Usually Perform Such As Checking Office Mails, Attending Office Meeting On Phone, Watching A Video From Amazon Prime, And So On. The Phone Did Not Heat Up Even A Little. Personally, This Is Good For Me.At This Price Range, This Is A Good Phone. But If You Are Camera Heavy User And Expect To Perform Heavy Downloads Frequently, This Phone May Not For You. I Am Personally Satisfied With This Phone As It Works For My Type Of Usage. I Will Not Go Into Plus Points Of This Phone As They Are Covered By Other Reviews Already. I Am Only Attempting To Clarify About How This Phone Can Suit You (Or Not) In Terms Of Camera And Heating. I Had Many Questions About These Aspects Before Buying. Perhaps This Review Will Help You Make An Informed Decision To Buy (Or Avoid).

In This Price Range Also It Is One Of The Best Tws Under 1500. I Will Tell Why.. Now A Days Many Brands Are Launching Tws In The Market Under 1500. Most Of Them Sound Almost Similar, Difference Is Like 19/20!! They Are Just Marketing Their Tws With Huge Hours Of Battery Backup & By Youtubers,Reviewers. 48/50 Hours Of Playtime Is Just Myth. I'Ve Personally Used Truke(Airbuds Lite,Buds F1) Which Is By Far The Most False Promising Brand Claiming 48 Hours Of Battery In Their Every Tws,But Only Give 21 Hours. Even Other Tws Of Boat(Airdopes 121 Pro) Which Claim 40-45 Hours Playback Only Give Around 25 Hours,Defy Gravity Z Claiming 50 Hours Only Give 28 Hours. If You Are Impressed By Their Looks & Huge Battery Backup And Thinking To Buy Those,You Will Be Disappointed After Purchase. Instead Go With This,You Will Not Be Disappointed.,I Read The Negative Comments First And Decided Not To Buy It Because The Comments Said It Gives High Latency On Gaming Like Pubg And Also It Falls From Ear While Running. And That The Difference Between Normal And Beast Mode Slightly Had Differencebut A Pubg Youtuber Recommended Me This So I Decided To Give It A Try, After Trying Out Myself.Let Me Provide The Facts For Youi Have A Boat Rockerz 510 Headphone Which Obviously Should Be Better Than This Airdope But This Airdope Surprised Me By Doing 2X Better In Providing Accurate Sound In Pubg.It‚ÄôS Been 2-3 Days I Used It Daily For 6-7 Hours On Full Charge, It Has No Buttons And It Works On Touch Sensor Which Was Impressive For Me And In Pubg It Doesn‚ÄôT Give Delay As Written In The Comments, It Has A Good Latency Better Than What I Had Expected From The Negative Comments.Sometimes Though I Faced The Issue Where One Side Of The Airdope Stops Working Because It‚ÄôS Either On Standby Without Detecting The User Or A Bug Which Is Included In The Faq/Guide/Help Card In The Box I‚ÄôM Satisfied In Terms Of Gaming.For Sports Like Running I Wouldn‚ÄôT Recommend Because It Slips Away However Maybe U Can Tie The Airdope With A Thread Attached To Ur Neck So That It‚ÄôS Safe From Landing On The Ground I‚ÄôM Gonna Try That, Please Don‚ÄôT Use Both The Airdopes While Running On The Roads With Vehicles Running For Your Own Safety Keep One Side Of Your Ear Free For Hearing Sounds From Your Environment.,Pros:1. The Level Of Volume It Gets To, Is Just Awesome, It Can Get Incredibly Loud So If You'Re At The Gym, These Are Perfect.2. Awesome Bass!3. Noise Cancellation Is Just Great, If You Simply Put Them On Without Even Any Music Playing, U Won'T Be Able To Hear Things Around U Very Well, It'S Great For Places Like Gym.4. Lovely Battery Life, I'Ve Had Them A Week And Only Had To Charge The Case Once, That Too For Just A Few Minutes. And The Earbuds Themselves, Leave Them In Case For Just Five Min And You'Ll Be Getting Battery For A Long Long While.5. They Are Very Comfortable, Can Be Used For Long Periods Of Time.6. Affordable!7. The Touch Controls Are Very Responsive, Tap To Pause, Double Tap Right One For Next Song, Double Tap Left One For Either Rewind Or Previous Song. Can Also Pick Up Calls Just By Tapping.8. Multiple Ear Coverings Are Provided With It.9. Type C Portcons:1. The Sound Quality Is Not Bad Or Anything But It Is Slightly Muffled As Compared To Good Quality Headphones Etc. The Bass Is The Highlight So It'S Great For Music, But For Movies Or Gaming, You Won'T Get The Most Crisp Audio.2. Some Connectivity Issues, Sometimes I Have To Turn My Bluetooth On And Off Many Times For It To Work (This Is Occasional, Not A Daily Or Frequent Occurrence) [Edit After 1 Month Use: It'S Now A Very Frequent Issue]3. The Mic Quality Is Good If You Are Using Your Phone, But For Some Reason The Quality Is Really Bad If You Are On Pc4. Sometimes On Whatsapp, The Mic Will Not Be Detected If You Are On Call With These Earbuds, So You Will End Up Having To Take Them Off To Accept A Call Sometimes. (Not An Issue If You Are The One Dialing) I Hope It'S Just A Whatsapp Issue Rather Than Earbuds Issue.Overall, I Needed These For My Gym Since They Play Horrible Music There (Lol) So I'M Very Very Happy With Themhighly Recommended For Music And/Or As A More Affordable Option As Compared To Jbl Etc.",Https://M.Media-Amazon.Com/Images/I/31Gubefg3Fl._Sx300_Sy300_Ql70_Fmwebp_.Jpg,Https://Www.Amazon.In/Airdopes-141-Playtime-Resistance-Bluetooth/Dp/B09N3Znhty/Ref=Sr_1_2?Qid=1672902995&S=Computers&Sr=1-2

Some Things-The Whole Step Tracking Thing, I Bought It Due To That Reason, It Didn'T Basically Satisfy Me To That Level With That, But It Does Count Steps Accurately In The Walking Mode(Activity)Its Got Some Scratches In It.. But Its Not That Noticeable At First Glancethe Backgrounds, I Believe It Could'Ve Been Wayyyy Better If We Could Change 4-5 Backgrounds Of 10, But We Can Only Have 2, 1 Customised And 1 Download From The App(Which Has Limited Options)  The Other Backgrounds Are Just.. Eh..The Looks, I'Ll Give It 9/10, It'S Good Looking Stylish Differenttouch Screen Is Goodthe Sleep Tracking Too Is Kinda Accurate(I Still Haven'T Understood It That Well Lol)Battery Life Is Muah, I Use It Without Bluetooth And It Easily Survives For 6-7 Daysspo2 And Heart Rate, I Just Believe What It Says As I Can'T Check Prove If That'S Correct.The Water Resistance, I Haven'T Used It In Water (Ofc Am Scared) The Calling Feature Works Fine.. Its Got Good Sound Overall Its A Decent Watch And Can Be Used In Day To Day Activities, Am Quite Satisfied With It As My First Smart Watch üòó,I'Ve Used This Product For 4 Days, And I'M Going To Rate The Various Features And Different Aspects Of This Smartwatch Which Could Help The Customers Here -So, Bluetooth Calling (4/5) - The In-Built Mic Of This Watch Is Excellent And The Voice Gets To The Other Side Without Any Disturbance, Watch Connects Smoothly With The Mobile And Don'T Get Disconnected Automatically Until You Do It Yourself Through Watch Or Phone. Only Con Is You Can'T Silent The Incoming Call Which Is Annoying Sometime, Hope They Fix It With An Update.Built Quality And Looks (4.5/5) - Metallic Built Which Looks Premium And Straps Are Also Quite Smooth And Comforting. Best Thing Is, It Also Looks Good Over Skinny Wrists(Poor Me, With 5.6 Inch Wrist). Only Con Is You Can Get Scratches On Display So Protect With It Some Sort Of Screen Guard.Touch Screen (5/5) - It'S Almost Buttery Smooth Without Any Lag Which Is Pretty Impressive For A Smartwatch Under 2K. I Bet You Will Not Get Any Laggy Experience Ever.Accuracy (3.5/5) - Spo2 And Hr Has Fairly Decent Accuracies, It Gives You A Rough Idea Of Your Being, So Its Quite Reasonable For A Watch Under 2K. Count Steps With Decent Accuracy As Well. Sleep Accuracy Is Also Just Acceptable.To Sum Up, You Should Definitely Go For This Watch If You'Ve A Budget, Constrained Under 2000 Rs,,I Recently Purchased The Fire Bolt Phoniex Watch, Which Is Quite Stylish, And The Bluetooth Calling Is Excellent. The Voice Gets To The Other Side Without Any Disturbance.The Build Quality Is Good Over The Wrists, But You Can Get Scratches On The Display, So Protect It With Some Screen Guard. You Should Go For This Watch If You Want A Budget-Friendly Smartwatch Under 2000.,It'S A Good Watch But I Have Faced Two Problems In It The First One Is There Is No Feature Of Raise To Wake And The Second One Is There Is No Option To Silent It When Someone Calls You.....I Think You Should Purchase It If In Future Company Add These Two Features...,I Recently Purchased The Fire Boltt Phoenix Watch, And I Am Very Happy With My Purchase. The Watch Is Quite Stylish, And I Get Compliments Every Time I Wear It. The Watch Is Also Quite Comfortable To Wear, And The Strap Is Adjustable To Fit Any Wrist Size. The Watch Also Has A Great Battery Life, And I Can Go For Days Without Having To Charge It. The Watch Also Has A Number Of Features, Including A Step Counter, Heart Rate Monitor, And Sleep Tracker. All Of These Features Are Very Useful And Make It Easy To Track My Activity And Health. Overall, I Am Very Pleased With My Purchase And Would Highly Recommend The Fire Boltt Phoenix Watch To Anyone Who Is Looking For A Stylish And Functional Watch.,This Watch Is Absolutely Stunning And Great Value For Money. Really Pleased With The Design And Shape Of Watch, Definitely A Must Buy For Every Person .Loved The Colour, Durability And Accuracy Is Super üëç. Just Go For It.,I Liked The Product It Has So Many Features Like Sleep Tracking, Sp02, Heart Rate Measuring, Music Player, Temperature Checker My Only Nitpick Would Be That It Only Have 2 Games And Secondly It Has Good Wallpapers But A Ben 10 Omnitrix Wallpaper Would Give It An Even More Awesome Look",Https://M.Media-Amazon.Com/Images/I/41Shrwxcfvl._Sx300_Sy300_Ql70_Fmwebp_.Jpg,Https://Www.Amazon.In/Fire-Boltt-Phoenix-Bluetooth-Calling-Monitoring/Dp/B0B3Rrwsf6/Ref=Sr_1_3?Qid=1672902995&S=Computers&Sr=1-3

Bought This Yesterday, So Haven‚ÄôT Used It Much, So An Early Review. But The Most Detailed Review So Please Read Till The End. Very Important Points Are Mentioned.Looks Are Cute! It Looks Really Nice And Elegant. I Am Using It With A Macbook Air. So Far It Seems There Are No Problems Using It. The Scrolling Is Smooth, Connection Does Not Drop, And There Is No Lag. Connection Is Instant. There Is No Pairing Required. It'S Plug And Play Along With The Dongle Provided With It.It Sits Low On The Table, Feels Weighty But Not In A Wrong Way. The Battery Adds To It'S Weight, But I Have Used Heavier Mice Before, And This One Feels Just Right. It Has Good Grip. Nothing To Complain About That.Buttons Are Nice And Clicks Are Satisfactory, Not Too Noisy; They Are Just Right. Scroll Wheel Doesn'T Feel Cheap At All, Though I Believe It Could'Ve Been Better Quality. Body Is Matt Finish And Doesn'T Leave Fingerprints On It, Though If You'Re Someone Who Eats And Handles The Mouse, Then It'Ll Show The Oil Prints And That'S True With Any Peripherals. The Mouse Doesn'T Feel Cheap Overall, But It Is Definitely Plasticky, Though Not In The Bad Sense. It Is Definitely Not Cheap Looks Wise.There Is An On, Off Switch On The Bottom Which Is Helpful In Saving The Battery (Which Is Included) When The Mouse Is Not In Use. There Is No Light On The Bottom Which Is Good If You Have Kids In The House Who Keep Flipping The Mouse And Staring At The Super Bright Light. So That'S A Good Thing And A Definite Plus! The Overall Shape And Size Works In The Favour Of The Mouse, And A Variety Of Users With Small And Large Palms Will Be Satisfied With It.Now Over To A Major Flaw. The Mouse Connects Only Though It'S Own Usb Dongle (Which By The Way Comes Tucked Inside The Body Of The Mouse Itself, Inside The Battery Door, Which I Found Mighty Impressive) And Not Through The Laptop'S Bluetooth. Now This Means Two Things- 1. You Have To Carry Around The Usb Dongle With You Everywhere You Go, Which Means If You Happen To Forget It At Home While Traveling And Carry Just The Mouse, Then The Mouse Is Pretty Much Useless In That Scenario. And Worse Still, If You Happen To Carry It Out Of Station With You And Bring Back Only The Mouse And Forget To Pack The Dongle, Then You'Re Stuck And I Don'T Think You Get Only The Dongle (You'Ll Have To Check That With The Seller), And  Then The Mouse Is Left Useless In That Case. 2. Now Over To  The Problem I Am Facing, Which I Did Not See Anyone Else Mention In Their Reviews. I Use A Macbook, So It Doesn'T Have Usb-C Inputs, Which Means You Must Buy A Connector For It To Connect The Dongle. I Actually Had Already Bought A Connector So That Was Not A Problem For Me, But You Will Have To Factor In The Cost Of The Connector, Which Is Not Cheap, Because You Want To Buy Only Good Quality Connector For Your Expensive Macbook. Of Course That Is A Problem With The Macbook And Not With The Mouse, But Consider This Point. It Is Very Important. It Will Not Connect Over Macbook'S Bluetooth. Otherwise, It Works Well With The Macbook. The Only Caveat I Found Is The Tracking Speed On Level 2 Is Too Slow And On Level 3 Is Too Fast. You'Ll Have To Get Used To That Thing. It Doesn'T Feel Very Natural (As The Trackpad On The Macbook Feels) Because Of That Speed Problem, But Otherwise, The Pointer Flows Smoothly On Screen And Doesn'T Jump Around, At Least With My Mouse. Also, The Battery Door Does Make A Noise When Landing The Mouse On The Pad, And I Feel It Could Have Been Made Better. But I Guess At The Cost, You Really Can'T Complain Too Much.Overall, I Think A Good Buy, But The Compulsion Of Having To Use It With It'S Own Dongle Is A Major Drawback I Feel. If That Doesn'T Bother You, Then Nothing Else Should Keep You From Buying This Product, Especially Since It Is One Of The Cheapest Wireless Mice Out There At Less Than 600 Bucks, Which Is What It Cost Me.,The Quality Of Power Button Is Very Low Easily It Can Break,Nice Product, Works As Expected As Of Now No Issues,Good,Very Smooth, Works On Almost Every Surface, Paper, Table, Cloth Etc.There'S A Bit Rattle Sound Of The Plastic Which Is Just Above The Buttons (Right/Left Clicks)It Will Not Bother Most Of You, I Am A Bit Obsessive With These Kind Of Things, So...[Personally I Opened The Mouse And Stuck A Paper Inside The Plastic Which Presses The Click Button, Resulting In No Rattle Sound. Now Mouse Only Makes Sound When You Click The Buttons, (Click Click Click)]Battery Life Of Logitech Is Known To Be Very Good.,Quality Good, Dpi Good, Good Accuracy On Off Switch Available, Smooth, Good Deal At Reasonable Price.,Good Product On Which You Can Use For Long Time,This Is Good Mouse, Thanks To Amazon For Providing This Product At Reasonable Price. Very Sharp And Correct Working Mouse.",Https://M.Media-Amazon.Com/Images/W/Webp_402378-T2/Images/I/31Y-Oj1Xnql._Sx300_Sy300_Ql70_Fmwebp_.Jpg,Https://Www.Amazon.In/Logitech-B170-Wireless-Mouse-Black/Dp/B01J0Xwykq/Ref=Sr_1_6?Qid=1672902995&S=Computers&Sr=1-6

Bass Is Also Ok. Mic Quality Is Also Good In Indoor Condition. Receiver Can Clearly Listen To You. I Didn'T Use It In Noisy Environment Or In Outdoors. Company Claims There Is Low Latency While Gaming,I Don'T Know Exactly If It Works Or Not. Sound & Call Quality Wise It'S Good One..But The Problem Is With Battery Backup. Company Claim It Will Give Battery Backup Of 40 Hours With Case. 8 Hours In Single Charge+Additional 32 Hours(4 Times Charge Via Case) This Is Misleading. It Only Gives Total 25 Hours Playback. I'Ve Tested It Myself.It Will Give Around 7 Hours Backup On Single Charge Of Buds @ 50-60% Volume(If You Only Listen To Music Or Watching Video,But No Call Or Gaming) You Can Charge The Earbuds Full Only 2.5 Times Via Case: So Additional 18 Hours. If You Try To Charge After 2Nd Time It Will Only Charge The Buds Around 60%,Then It Goes Off. (After 1St Charge The Case Has 48% Battery Left,2Nd Time It Is Down To 12%,Then 3 Rd Time It Goes To 0%)They Mentioned Earbuds Have 40 Mah Battery Each,380 Mah Battery In Case. It Is Mentioned In Product Manual,But In Boat Website It Is Written 400 Mah Instead Of 380.Technically 40 Hours Backup Is Also Not Possible.It Has 380 Mah Battery In Case,It Acts Like A 380Mah Powerbank. So Let Assume It'S Efficiency Is 60%. So It Will Give Output Of 228 Mah.(It Is Less Than Mentioned Capacity Due To Energy Loss  While Energy Transfer) Now Each Earbud Has 40 Mah,So Total 80 Mah. Now Buds Can Be Charged Via Case 228√∑80=2.85 Times.That'S It.,Having Bought This For Roughly ‚Çπ1300, I Must Say That I'M Not Too Satisfied With The Product In Many Ways.1. Pairing Is Very Simple And It Connects Very Quickly.2. The Build Quality Is Actually Very Good. It'S All Plastic But It Looks Quite Durable As Long As You'Re Not Too Rough With It.3. Audio Is Decent, Not Too Impressive. My Wired Earphones (Boat Bassheads) Are Quite Frankly Much Better.4. This Is Not For Gaming. I Play Call Of Duty: Mobile And The Latency Is Just Painful. Even With ""Beast Mode"" Turned On, I Felt No Difference As The The Lag Still Persisted.5. The Battery Backup Is Actually Great. The Only Positive Thing I Can Think Of Is The Battery Backup. I Got Roughly 3 Hours Of Playtime And The Battery Had Drained From 100% To 80%. The Quick Charge Is A Cherry On Top.Overall, I'D Say It'S Performance Is Very Average. Definitely Not Worth ‚Çπ1300 In My Opinion.,,Not Adaptive For Every Person'S Ear. My Wife Doesn'T Suit The Ear Airdopes.  Partially Satisfied. 799/- Rupees I Bought.

First About The Product Itself.  It'S Sound Quality Is Very Good. Bass Lovers Will Just Love It. Average Mids And High.  It Lasts About 25-28 Hrs With A Full Charge. Also Tested On Heavy Rain While Driving ( Don'T Worry , Earphones Were Not Plugged In.. üòÇ). It Was On My Neck. But There Was No Water Ingress.Now The Major Problem Kicks In . After 10 Months Left Speaker Was Not Working. So , I Registered A Complaint On Boat Website. They Picked My Earphone For Replacement.  But Later It Was Replaced With "" Rockerz 255 Pro "" Instead Of "" Rockerz 255 Pro + "" . Why ? Even After A Lot Of Conversations With Boat Support They Didn'T Provide Me My Model . Now I'Ve To Stick With These Low Quality Ear Peace. Hence ,Try To Avoid Boat Online Support For Warranty Claim And Better Visit Physical Service Entre. Good Luck.Edit : After Having Conversation With Higher Authorities On Twitter, They Replaced The Same With My Model .Edit 2 : From First Day Onwards After Receiving The Replacement Product I Was In Doubt That The Sound Quality Was Decreased A Lot. So, Again I Replaced With The Authorized Service Centre For Flat ( No/ Very Low Bass)  Sound.  But The 2Nd Replacement Is Also Same. I Thought I'Ve Some Issues With My Ear Lol üòÜ . But Today When I Listened To My Friends Rockerz 255 Pro + (Same As Mine But The Retail Unit) I Was Surprised And Thankful Too . My Ear Was Not Damaged . It Had The Same Punchy Bass And That Signature Sound Which Was Absent From My Replacement Unit.So, I Can Conclude By Saying The Replacement Product Will Not Have That Signature Sound As The Retail Unit.If Anybody Has Experienced The Same Please Comment.Thanks,I Would Recommend It Very Strongly If You Want A Budget Friendly Gaming Earphone Sometimes May Feel A Lag After Purchasing But After Some Time It Works Very Fine But It Also Has Some Cons Like The Build Quality My Earbuds Gone Worn Off By Normal Daily Use As Well As There Rubber Quality Is Not That Much Good Also Mic It Is Not That Good But It Is Okay So It Is The Best Earphone Under Your Budget....If Aman Gupta Is Watching This Review You May Gift Me A Earphone üòâüòÖ,Thanks To Amazon For Such Good Deliverance Of The Products,, I Have Been Using Amazon For Long Time And Amazon Have Truely Win The Trust Of The Customer.

Review Is Based On Testing Done The Same Day:Summary:The Product Is Genuine And Sturdy, But The Performance Is Just About Average, Based On A Random File Copy Performance To Fill The Entire Space.Pros & Cons (Comparing With Sandisk Cruiser Blade 32 Gb) :Pros-1. Solid Body, Looks And Feels Great.2. Read Speed Is Fine (22 Mb/S).3. Product Is Genuine, Covered Under 2 Year Manufacturer Warranty.Cons -1. Fits Too Tight In Usb Port, Thus Causing More Wear To The Port And May Even Damage It If Not Used Carefully.2. Capacity Is 31 Gb (Precisely 31042043904 Bytes), Not 32 As Advertised. In Windows It'Ll Show Up As A 28.9 Gb Drive Compared To 29.8 In Sandisk. No Big Deal, Just A Technical Observation.3. Write Speed (3.3 Mb/S) Is Not Bad, But Slightly Inferior To Its Close Competitor Sandisk Cruiser Blade Which Easily Gives 4 To 4.4 Mb/S For The Same Test.4. Warranty Is Only 2 Years, Compared To 5 Years On Sandisk. But Since Almost Nobody Claims Warranty After 2 Years, And Besides- The Plastic Body Of Sandisk Gets Physically Damaged In 2 Years Anyway, So It'S Okay For Me.Bottomline:It'S Good Enough For Casual Users, Maybe Chosen Over Sandisk For Its Look, Feel And Sturdiness. Frequent Users May Want To Look For Better Options- With Easier Port Fitting And Better Write Speed.Details:The Product Name Is Hp V236W As Shown On Its Packing (The Images In Listing Are Correct) While Its Part Number Is Fd236W-32, So Slightly Confusing But Both Are The Same Thing.Testing Whether It Is Genuine Or Fake:The Bottom Of The Hologram Sticker On The Packing Has A Silver Layer With ""Scratch And Check"" Written On It. Scratching It Reveals A 20-Digit Code Beneath It, And The Right Edge Of The Sticker Has The Url ""Www.Pny.Com.Tw"" To Verify This Code. Go To Support > Product Authentication Page On That Url. That Page Contains Instructions And Explanation Of The Results That You May Get. Mine Were Originals, With The Codes Tested For The First Time (Repeat Test Result Will Be A Warning That The Code Was Tested Before).So That Means It Is Covered Under 2 Year Manufacturer Warranty, As Declared By Hp For Aisa Pacific Region.Design And Build Quality : Sturdy, Stylish But With A Design Flaw-It Is Exactly As Shown In The Picture. The Body Is A Solid Steel Case With Open Front And The Back Sealed With A Black Plastic Cap. The Plastic Back Fits Perfectly And Gives It A Stylish Look, Though It May Come Off Later. The Hp Logo, Product Code Etc Are Embossed On The Steel Body So Likely Won'T Be Erased With Time. Overall, It Looks And Feels Great. The Flaw I Noticed Was That It Takes Significantly More Strength To Push It Into The Usb Port, Compared To Other Usb Devices Like Generic Usb Cables Or Usual Plastic Pendrives Like Sandisk. You Almost Have To Fight With It To Push It In Or Pull It Out. This Means Its Frequent Use Can Wear Out The Usb Port Too Soon, Or May Even Break It If Not Used Carefully.Capacity : 31 Gb, Not 32, Will Appear As 28.9 Gb In Windows-It Is Advertised As A 32 Gb Drive But The Actual Capacity Is 31Gb, And Yes, I'M Fully Aware Of The Decimal Vs Binary Calculation Difference, I'M A Hardcore Linux User. To Be Precise, Its Exact Capacity Is 31042043904 Bytes (On Both Pendrives I Tested). So In Windows It Will Show Up As A 28.9 Gb Drive. In Linux It Will Show Up As Either 31 Gb, Or 28.9 Gib (Binary Calculation Like Windows). For Comparison, My 32Gb Sandisk Shows Up As 32010928128 Bytes, Or 32 Gb, Or 29.8 Gib. This Loss Of 1 Gb In A 32Gb Pendrive Is No Big Deal For Me, Just A Technical Observation.Performance:Read Speed: About 20-22 Mb/Swrite Speed: About 3.3 Mb/Stested With : A Collection Of Iso Files Ranging From About 350Mb To 4Gb, Along With A Few Smaller Files Like Pdf Or Txt. Total Size Of The Collection Was About 30.2 Gb (28.2 Gib).I Did This Testing On Linux, So To Be Fair, The Write Performance May Be Slightly Better On Windows As It Works Better With Fat32 That The Pendrive Comes Formatted As.(Edit: No Performance Difference On Windows Either. Formatted As Exfat On Windows 10 To Make It Multiboot With Yumi. Read-Write Speeds Were Same While Copying Iso Files To It, Or Reading Them To Load In Memdisk While Booting.)I Could Do More Accurate Testing With Tools Like Dd Command But Didn'T Bother As The Difference Usually Isn'T Very Significant.,Ups.....The Product Is Very Good, I Mistakenly Washed It 8N Washing Machine With My Pants But It Is Still Running Like New. No Data Loss Problem Or Data Corrupt Problems I Have Faced Yet.Downs......The Only Downside Is This Pendrive Is Little Slow Because Of Technology 2.0(3.2 Is Newer One)And Second One Is Not Affact Your Data At All.. The Silver Paint On Pendrive Is Vanishing Time By Time And It Is Now Turning Black,Product Is Good But Slow,Storage Is Good But Doesn‚ÄôT Work For Car Stereo,57 Gb Out Of 64,So Far So Good,Good Product,Ok",Https://M.Media-Amazon.Com/Images/I/31Febya30Ql._Sx300_Sy300_Ql70_Fmwebp_.Jpg,Https://Www.Amazon.In/Hp-V236W-64Gb-Usb-Drive/Dp/B01L8Znwn2/Ref=Sr_1_21?Qid=1672902995&S=Computers&Sr=1-21

Recieved It Today.Checked It By Connecting To My Phone And I Was Surprised By The Audio Quality. This Is A Nice Product In This Price Range And The Mic Is Also Good. The Build Quality Is Average And You Can'T Complain Considering The Price. It Also Has A Clip To Attach The Earphone To Your Shirt Like The Good Old Nokia Days. It Has Total 3 Pair Or Ear Tips (2 In A Zipper Packet And 1 Already Attached To The Earphone).  The Manufacturing Date Is March 2022. So, It'S Quite New Actually, Not An Old Stock. It Also Has That Anti-Slip Ear Hook, Which Is An Added Advantage. In General, It Is A Good Product For This Price.,I Was Looking For Reliable Bluetooth Earbuds On A Budget, And Settled On These. Personally, I Am Pleased With Them. I Have Been Using Them For Almost Four Months Now, Including One Month When They Saw Around 12 Hours Of Use Per Day.Pros:‚ñ™ Comfortable.‚ñ™ Elegant And Sober Appearance.‚ñ™ Reasonable Battery Life. I Would Let The Earbuds Recharge At, For Example, Mealtimes.‚ñ™ Decent Range. Going A Few Meters Into The Next Room, With A Concrete Wall In Between, Was No Issue.‚ñ™ The Battery Status Of The Dock Is Shown By A Series Of Led Blinks. Simple And Practical.Cons:‚ñ™ Mediocre Phone Calling Quality. In Particular, The Microphone. The Few Conversations I Had Using These Went Successfully, So This Was Not A Deal Breaker, But The Clarity Was Not The Best For Sure.The Touch Controls Were Initially A Drawback For Me, But I Got Used To Them. Also, This Product Does Not Come With A Charger. Either Charge Off Of Your Computer, Or Buy A Charger With The Recommended Electrical Output. As For The Sound Quality, It Is Acceptable, Not Superlative. I Have Listened To Music, And I Have Watched Films And Youtube Videos, With No Problem.As A Final Note, I Prefer This Type Of Earbud Over The In-Ear Type, Because I Find It More Hygienic. Wiping With A Clean Cloth After Each Use, And Leaving The Lid Of The Dock Open For Some Time, Should Help To Slow Fungal Growth.,Very Good Product, Nicely Fits In The Ear And Comfortable .The Volume Seems To Be A Little Low At The Highest.But, A Good Buy,Sound Quality Is Good Everything Is Balanced But Bass Dominance Is Too High And Couldn'T Hear The Treble And Other Notes,Very Good Bass Quality And Worth For Money Earphones I Ever Buy..

It'S Too Long Else Good Mic For Beginners On Yt,Working As Expected,Nice Product,Good üëç","Note :@ Its Ready To Go Mic, Which Doesn'T Need Any Sound Card And Can Be Plugged And Used Directly Even With Smartphones.* Has 3.5Mm Jack Connector Built In, You Can Use 1/4' Connector If Needed.@ It Has Very Long Cable Which Measures Upto 20 Feet, So Note That.@ It Has Absolutely No Noise Isolation And Normal Smartphone Earphones Does Better Job Of Noise Reduction Compared To Them In Stock Condition, But With Simple Editing This Mic Works Just Fine ( Check The Review Below For Detailed Settings )There Are Literally Thousands Of Review On This Product, But None Explained The Best Possible Settings For It When Used With Smartphone With Audacity Software, Or Even In General. So I Took The Risk Of Ordering It And It Turned Out To Be Nightmare Right Out Of The Box, As The Sound Output Was Worse Than My Smartphone Earphones. So I Went To Search For Best Settings On Amazon & Other Sources But In Vain. Fortunately I Myself In Experiments Found The Solution And Now Its Working Just Fine.First I Am Mentioning All The Pros And Cons Considering The Settings That I Found And Then Listing Those Settings,Pros :-------1. Built Quality Of The Complete Mic And Cable Is Good For The Price Given.2. Length Of Cable Is Insane (20 Feet).* I Personally Didn'T Find It Useful, As I Use It With My Smartphone Which Is Just Couple Of Feet Below In My Pockets, But For Some Users It Can Be Very Useful If Using In Rig Setup With Camera.3. Has Universal 3.5Mm Jack, Which Is Handy.4. Its Easy To Use, Just Plug And Play Device, Which Doesn'T Need Any Sound Card Or External Device To Work.5. Has Support For Multiple Device Right From Smartphones To Dslrs And Computers.6. It Comes With Carry Pouch Which Is Very Handy, Since Its A Mess With Such Long Cables.Cons :--------1. Biggest Con Is The Sound Quality Right Out Of The Box. Its Just Garbage Quality And Even Normal Ears Can'T Bear The Background Noise Collection, So Forget About Audiophiles. My Normal Smartphone'S Earphones Record Much Better Sound Quality Compared To This.2. Length Of Cable Is Way Too Much For Me And I Guess For Many Users. I Think There Should Have Being Multiple Option On Length To Choose From, As Keeping 20 Feet Cable Wrapped And Hanging Or In Pocket While Recording Is Not Comfortable.3. It Comes With A Button Cell For Recording Sound For Devices Other Than Smartphone And There'S No Way To Know Whether The Battery Is Dead Or What'S Its Charging Level. Only Way To Check Is By Plugging It To A Digital Recorder Or Computer And Test. So If You Are Carrying It With Recorder Which Doesn'T Has Playback Feature Or If You Are In Hurry And In Case Of Dead Battery To Record All The Sound, Then Only Way To Find That Your Efforts Are In Vain Will Be When You Comfortably Sit To Edit It And Trust Me, Its Very Frustrating ! I Am Mentioning, It As This Scenario Have Happened With Me Once, Hence I Am Very Cautious About Batteries Now & Use It With Smartphones Or Digital Recorders.4. I Think Price Should Have Being Couple Of Hundred Bucks Less, Considering The Sound Quality.Best Setting Using Audacity Software :===================================These Are The Settings When You Record With Smartphone Or Any Other Device And There Are Lots Of Background Noises And You Use Audacity Software, Which Is Free !1. Open The Software And Open The Audio File You Recorded With This Mic.2. Select Entire Audio Clip And Open ""Effects"" And Then "" Distortion ""3. Start The Playback Of Audio Clip In The Software, So You Can Listen To Change In Effects That You Are About To Make.4.Now Select "" Distortion Type "" Option On The Top Of Box And Select "" Soft Clipping "".* Or Select "" Hard Limiter "" And Do The Settings As It Sounds Suitable To You.5. Take The ""Clipping Level Cursor To Extreme Right End Or So Until You Hear Soft Pleasant Output.6. Adjust The ""Make-Up Gain"" Cursor Little Bit If Needed, I Keep It On 49.* Here You Can Select Which Ever Type, Which You Feel Is Suitable For You.7. Now Just Click "" Apply "".8. Now Is Noise Reduction. For That Select Short Section Of Audio Which Does Not Have Your Voice, But Only Has Background Noises That You Don'T Want.9. Open ""Effects"" And Then "" Noise Reduction ""10. Click On "" Get Noise Profile"".11. Now Select Entire Audio Clip And Again Open ""Effects"" And Then "" Noise Reduction "".12. Finally, Click On "" Ok "" And That'S It !Now You Are Good To Go With Soft, Slightly Lesser Noises And More Pleasant Sound Output. After These Steps, You Can Amplify The Sound From Same Software Or Any Other End User Software.Verdict :-----------I Personally Am Very Disappointed With The Sound Quality, Though The Audacity Tweaking Gets It To Bearable Level, But Its Satisfactory Enough. Plus Price Seems Slightly More On This. I Wouldn'T Recommend These Are Someone Looking Good Sound Quality Specially If You Live In Noisy Environment. Buy This Only If You Live In Very Silent Conditions.,It'S Not Great Or Best Out There For Beginners But Good-I Use A Budget Mid-Range Phone And The Boya Mic Is Better Than In Built Mic Of Phone. Record It In Wav Format, It'S Good.-You Gotta Use Software/Apps To Pull The Best Of This, Like Audacity Or Some Other Editing App.-It'S Pretty Long And That'S Good As You Can Extend The Cable To A Good Distance Say If U R Connecting It To The Camera On A Tripod.-Overall It'S Decent For Beginners. I See High-End Phones Have Good Recording Capabilities, But If You Have A Budget Phone, Then This One Is Deal.,Microphone Looks Very Well Built, It Supports Both Phones And Cameras. There Are Some Phones That Does Not Support External Mic, Please Check Before Buying As One Of My Phone Did Not Support It.They Claim Noise Cancellation, However, I Did Not Notice Major Difference It Also Captures Great Amount Of Noise, Only Cancellation Is Because Of Foam Padding Around The Microphone. I Could Not Observe Noise Cancellation, At Least, While Recording On Phone.Overall Package Is Well Bundled, Wire Quality Is Decent, However The Dongle Quality Is Excellent, Even The Small Clip To Hold The Microphone Feels Solid.,Wire Is To Long But Good If Quality Of Wire Is Improve In Future Then 5 Stars From Me But Now 4 Star Good Sound Low Price 1 Star - For Wire Quality But Over All A Nice Product.‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ,I Think It'S Good For Online Teaching Like I Do...But Yeah Some Problems Like Very Long Cable Length I Mean Someone Might Need But It Should Be Optional.... Or Detachable Price Of The Mic Itself Is Not Much Anywaysi Am Okay With This Mic For Sometime... Until I Am Sure I Need Quality Rode Mic To Upgrade...,Don'T Expect Noice Cancellation Under This Budget But Audio Recording Quality Is Very Good.,Nice Product,Decent",Https://M.Media-Amazon.Com/Images/I/41Uyenf+Lnl._Sx300_Sy300_.Jpg,Https://Www.Amazon.In/Boya-Omnidirectional-Lavalier-Condenser-Microphone/Dp/B076B8G5D8/Ref=Sr_1_32?Qid=1672902996&S=Computers&Sr=1-32

First Off, This Is My Second Time Buying The Product And You Guessed It, It'S Good Enough That I Will Buy It A Third Time If Need Be!Upon Unboxing We Are Greeted By The Presence Of 3 Pair Of Extra Ear Buds . There Is Also A Pair Of Ear Fins In The Packet Containing The Extra Ear Buds, These Ear Fins Are Used To Keep The Ear Buds Snugly In Your Ears During Strenuous Periods Of Use Where There Is A Chance Of Lots Of Movement. More On This Later.Coming To The Ear Phones Itself, It'S Among The Very Few Ear Phones That Genuinely Feels Premium In Hand. It Is Very Durable, Specially The Plug Part That Connects To Your Phone, Many A Time My Ear Phones Stop Working Because The Plug Part Malfunctions And Causes Problems In The Functioning Of The Ear Phones. This Is Not The Case With These.The Wire Itself Is Made Of Rubber/Silicon. It Feels Good In Hand And The Only Thing I Can Think Of That Could Be Improved Here Is To Braid The Wire But So Far The Wire Hasn'T Showed Any Form Of Wear And Tear Common With Most Other Ear Phone Wires. Another Thing To Emphasize Is That The Entire Cable Is Flat Through Out, This Genuinely Decreases The Number Of Instances Where I Find Myself Trying To Untangle The Wire. This Is Truly One Of The Best Features Of This Pair Of Earphones.Remember I Said Something About The Ear Phones Being Made Completely Of Metal? Well It Continues To The Mic And The Left And Right Splitter. Both These Pieces Feel Very Premium Because Of The Signature Cold Feeling Of Metal Against Skin. I Don'T Know About You But Attention To Small Details Like This Always Brings Smiles To My Face. It Is To Be Noted That The Mic Piece Is A Universal Single Button Type And Hence Cannot Control Volume, Personally This Problem Didn'T Affect Me Much But The Might Be Potential Buyers Who Might Find This To Be A Deal Breaker.Mic Quality Is Subject To Individual Bias Therefore I Can Tell You My Personal Experience. In My Opinion I Feel That The Quality Is Average, It Won'T Blow Anyone'S Mind But It Will Deliver Most Of The Time. A Common Complaint I Heard From Most Of My Callers That They Find It Difficult To Hear Me When There Is A Significant Amount Of Back Ground Noise Or Wind Rustling In To The Mic, These Are Common Issues Even With Ear Phones Price Significantly Higher Than The Boat Bassheads 152Finally The Most Important Part Of The Review, The Sound Quality Of The Ear Phones. As I Said Earlier I Won'T Be Going Into The Technical Details . I Am A Bass Lover And That Is What Led Me To Buy This Pair In The First Place. In My Opinion I Found That The Bass Is Indeed Good But Not Over Powering For The Average Consumer Like How The Extra Bass Versions Of The Sony Line Up Of Earphones Trend To Be. The Volume Gets Sufficiently High And More Often Than Not I Use It At Less Than Half It'S Total Volume When Listening To Music. The Clarity Of The Boat Bassheads 152 Are Above Par And Easily Betters Even Ear Phones In The 2000 Inr Price Category This Is One Other Reason Why I Love This Pair So Much. A Point To Remember, As The Entire Covering Of The Ear Phones Is Made Of Metal It Is Significantly Heavier Than Other Ear Phones. This Becomes A Double Edged Sword, On The One Hand The Metal Makes The Ear Phones Feel Very Premium But It Also Makes It Significantly Heavier Than Other Earphones Made Of Plastic. This Causes It To Easily Fall Out Of Your Ears If The Supplied Fins Are Not Used. The Find Unlike The Ones Find In Let'S Say The Newer Bose Ear Phones Aren'T As Comfortable And Can Hurt Your Ears If Used Over A Prolonged Time.Last But Not The Least, There Are Multiple Color Variants Of The Boat Bassheads 152 Including Red, Black And Blue. I Found Myself Opting For The Black Variant Both The Times This May Be A Personal Opinion But I Find It To Be The Best Of The Three. That Said I Do See Most Corporate Consumers Opting For The Black As It Is A Neutral Color. This Leaves Out The Red, For Reasons Unknown The Red Variant Is Sold At A Lower Rate On Most Sites Perhaps Due To Shortage In Sales, Therefore If You Are Short On Cash And Just Want A Great Pair Of Ear Phones Then Grab These While They Last.Pros:1) No Metal Build2) Excellent Wire Quality And Trendy3) Durable4) Above Average Sound Qualitycons:1) Metal Build In The Earphones Trend To Make Them Heavy And Thus Falls Out Of Your Ear Easily2) Supplied Fins Are Uncomfortable To Wear Over A Prolonged Time3) Supplied Clip Piece Is Removable And Tends To Get Lost Easilyi Hope Everyone Who Read This Found It Useful And Can Make An Educated Decision To Buy Or Not To Buy The Bassheads 220. All Suggestions Are Welcome.Thanking You, Dwarakesh,Best Quality  I Like Boat Earphone Saund Quality,Only Disadvantage  I Noticed Was This Can'T Be Use In Usb Phones,  3.5 Mm Jack Is Provided So It Can Be  Usedin Jack Phones Only .,Nice,Good,I Used This Headphone For Travel. Very Lite And Easy To Carry In Pocket. Colourful. Sound Quality Is Good. The Wire Is Thin So I Feel Cautious  While Taking It From Bag Or Pocket.,Gd One! Only Thing Is Covers/Sleeves Comes Out Easily If Not Gd Fit.

I Have Attached The Pic For It#Health Tracker Are Near To Accurate But Never Rely On Smartwatch At This Price Range.I Have Measure The Bp With This Watch And With Bp Machine Both Results Are Different... 70-80% Accurate Only..# Ai Voice Assistant Is Not Very Useful As It Only Work For Mobile When I Press The Voice Assistant Button On Watch .. Like If I Give Command To Set Alarm On Watch It Set Alarm On Mobile So Basically It Just A Button To Wake Up Google Assistant For Mobile Phone.#Sometimes When You Pick Call From Your Mobile Phone Call Automatically Transfer To Watch And Voice Started Coming From The Watch Speaker.. Which Is Quite Irritating..This Must Be Correct By Firmware Updates I Have Purchased It For Rs.3420/- Including Bank Offer . For This Price Range Overall Its A Good & Premium Watch ..Its My Experience With This Watch For Just A One Dayrest How It Work For Long Run That Depends..,Recieved A Damaged Device At First... Slight Gap Between Display And Body From The Left Side.. But Quickly Recieved The Replacement Next Day....The Replacement Was Good...Amazon Provided Great Service And Delivered Replacement In Just 16 Hours ...So Great Job Amazon..Also I Live In Bangalore.. So The Experience Might Vary From Place To Place..Prossmooth Enough Uifairly Accurate Readings On All The Sensorsheartrate Bp And Spo2Call Quality Is Great For The Price.. Good Speakers And Good Mic..You Can Control Spotify And Soundcloud Music Too From The Watch .And Use Tws To Listen To Spotify While Controling With The Watch...

Not As Narrow As Crossbeats Ignite S4 Max But Still Good Enough...Build Quality Is Good But Does Not Feel Very Premium.. It Does Feel Like A Below 5K Watch...So You Cannot Trick Anyone That This Is A Apple Watch üòÇStrap Is Not Too Long As Every Review Mentions.. Strap Is Good Enough... Not Too Comfy..I Ordered A Metal Strap From Amazon For My Watch And It Is Amazing...Ui Looks Much Better In Person Than Reviews.. Ui Is Smooth And Looks Good... Not As Good As Realme Watch 3 Pro..But Still Good For The Price..Overall Its A Good Watch For The Price Of Around 3.5K -3.9Kanymore And It Is Not Worth The Pricerealme Watch 3Pro Is The Best At Around This Price.. So If You Get That In Stock And For Below 4K Then Get Realme Watch 3 Pro..Or Else For This Price Segment Firebolt Visionary Is The Overall Best Watch Compared To All Other Watches Under 4Kconscall When Recieved On Watch Doesnt Stay On Tws It Switches To Watch For Some Reason..Which Is Onesteps Are A Little Inaccurate And Reads Steps Even If Not Walking..So Dont Rely On Step Counterbattery Life Is Not Great If Youre Using Always On Display And Calling... Maybe Around 3 Daysbut Otherwise Battery Stays For Over 5 Days.Blutooth Range Is Not Too Good.. And Varies From Watch To Watch.. And Also Phone To Phone.. I Get A Decent Bluetooth Range Of Around 20 Ft .. But This Is More Of A Fact Than A Con..,I Write This Review After 1 Week Of Using This Watch, Bp, Bpm, Spo2 Running And Sleep Tracking Functions Are Working Well, Watch Speaker Is Also Loud And Clear To You And The Other Callers. The Only Con Is When You Want To Listen To Songs Through A Watch From A Mobile Its Bluetooth Disconnects Automatically Again And Again, As This Fund Is Not Useful For Me So Ignore It, Overall It'S A Good Watch.,Everything Is Absolutely Greta In This Smartwatch.But These Things Could Have Been Better:. Watch Faces- You Should Have The Option To Add Upto 3-4 Watch Faces At Once From The App Rather Than One At A Time And 10 Pre-Installed Ones. App Ui Could Have Been Better. Dnd Mode Absent. No Option To Toggle Bluetooth (Always On),Before Review I Would Like To Appreciate This Great Strategy To Pour Out Honest Reviews From Users By Giving Them Bookmyshow Voucher.I Loved The Touch Screen Experience & Amoled Screen Of The Watch, It Gives A Feel Of Premium Watch. The Band Of The Watch Is Average & Doesn'T Look Premium & I Separately Ordered A Metal Band. I Am Expecting Mobile App Improvement From Fireboltt As I Don'T Find It Good Enough If I Compare It With Boat'S App For Its Watches (As I Own A Boat Smartwatch).

It Seemed Interesting - And Had Something Called Dirac Opteo In It + Anc. So I Thought I'D Give It A Shot.First-Day Impressions - It'S Blown Me Away!Exhaustive List Of Impressions:1. Dirac Opteo: Balanced Sound With Punchy Bass! Yeah, And Not Booming Bass. It'S So Great And I'M Quite Surprised It Sounds Like Something You'D Expect At A Higher Price Point.  1.1 Soundstage: As Soon As The Headphone Is Switched On, It Starts In 'Battery Saving Mode'. Once You Turn On Dirac Opteo Mode, You Can Literally Feel The Space Opening Up. All The Instruments Feel Individual And Sound Separated. Fireflies (By Owl City) Sounds Lovely And All The Strings Sway In The Centre While The Various Zaps And Buzzes Surround You. It'S Really Great For The Price!  1.2 Treble And Mids: Clean And Clear. The Bass Doesn'T Overpower Them And Feels Just Right. The Vocals Come Out Clearly And All The Instruments Don'T Interfere With It (Drive Home By Steven Wilson Sounds Great!).  1.3 Bass: Punchy And Tight. I Love How It Fizzles In 'Bonfire' (By Knife Party) And How It Reverberates In 'Turn Down For What' (By Dj Snake). 'Breakin' A Sweat'(By Skrillex, Zedd) Sounded Tight And I Discovered How Well Produced It Is! Lovers Of Tight Bass, This Is Your Product!2. Volume: It Gets Really Loud. So Loud That I Can'T Listen To It At The Highest Setting. But If That'S Your Thing, Then You Should Know That The Highs Get Pretty Shrill At The Setting, But The Bass Is Still Pretty Clean And Loud!3. Anc: Anc Is Present, But Won'T Drown Everything Out. It'S A Great Add On But If You'Re Looking For A Headphone To Make All Sounds Around You Zero, Then This Won'T Do That. If You Need To Drown Out Some Noise While You Listen To Your Tunes, This Will Do The Trick!  3.1 Ambient Sound Mode: The Opposite Of Anc, It Pulls In The Outside Noise To Let You Have A Conversation. Again, You Can'T Blast Tunes At High Volume And Still Have A Convo, But You Can Listen With Lower Volume (Near 25% Volume) And Hear Things Around You. If The Ambient Sound Also Increased As I Increased Volume, It Would Have Been Amazing.4. Calling: Did A Couple Of Calls. With No-Noise, The Other Person Said I Sounded Great! I Took A Couple Of Calls In A Local Grocery Store (Was Pretty Loud) And The Other End Had No Issue Hearing Me.5. Buttons: The Button Placement Is Easy And I Didn'T Feel Any Issue Getting Used To The Controls. The Simple Manual Explains Everything In 2 Mins, So Read Once And You'Re Good To Go.  5.1 To Note: The Sound Is Best In Dirac Opteo Mode. Every Time You Turn It On, You Have To Double Press The Multi Function Button To Turn It On. I'D Have Loved Having It On By Default. Also Every Time I Turn It On, It Plays A 3-4 Second Tune, Which Could Have Been Shorter. (Imagine Hearing It Every Time You Turn The Thing On. Ugh.)6. Connectivity: Once I Connected It To My Phone The First Time, It Connects To My Phone Within 1-2 Seconds Of Turning The Earphones On.7. Battery: It Seems To Last Long! I'Ve Been Using Them For About 4.5 Hrs And It'S Gone Down About 20%. Cannot Say Anything More Yet Though.  7.1 When You Take Both The Earphones Out Of Your Ears, It Doesn'T Auto Pause Like Some Of The Competitors. Annoyed That This Was Missed, Would Have Saved So Much More Battery If They Did This.8. Build Quality: I Have A Black Version. It'S Made With Good Quality Plastic And Didn'T Feel Heavy Around My Neck. It Doesn'T Have Metal Anywhere, And It'S Quite Simple. I Think It Looks Decent.9. Exercise: Need To Test! Will Update Later.In Summary, An Easy Recommendation. If You Can Overlook The Small Issues, There'S A Great Sounding, Feature-Packed And Long Lasting Device Here At A Great Price! 10/10 Would Definetely Recommend!,First I Was Bit Sceptical About The Build Quality But Have To Say It'S Got A Pretty Sturdy Material And Decent Quality Buttons, Bass Is Good, Vocals Are Much Clearer In Crystal Bionic Mode, Anc Is Working To A Degree Will Definitely Cancel Out The Noise Of Your Celing Fan But Don'T Except Any More Than That, No Issues With Call Enx Is Working Upto It'S Name, Battery Is Sufficient Around 12-14 Hours If You Mix Up The Modes.. Overall A Decent All Rounded Neckband, Jack Of All And King Of None.,All Other Things Such As Sound Quality, Battery Backup Are Very Good But Multiple Device Pairing Is Implemented Very Poorly. If I Connect With Laptop And Try To Connect With Phone At Same Time. It Does Not Work Many Times. If Headphones Are Connected To Laptop And You Close The Laptop Without Shutting It Down Then You Won'T Be Able To Connect With Phone Again Unless And Until You Disconnect With Laptop. This Is A Big Bug. Please Fix This.,This Boat 330 Anc Neckband Is Very Good But Needs Improvement And Fixes.Pros:-‚Ä¢ Nice Sound Quality While Using Crystal Bionic Sound, But It'S Average On Normal Mode Which Feels A Little More Bassy And Losses Clarity At Certain Points.‚Ä¢ Great Build Quality‚Ä¢ It'S Anc & Ambience Mode Is Good In This Price Range.‚Ä¢ It'S Quite Comfortable To Wear For Long Sessions As Per My Ear Fitting.‚Ä¢ It Has Dual Pairing Which Is Very Good But It'S Not Very Seamless And There Is A Small Issue With Dual Pairing, E.G., While Receiving A Call On One Device, The Audio/Video Being Played At Another Device Won'T Pause (You Have To Manually Pause) Instead There Won'T Be Any Sound Output Through That Device. Its A Little Issue But It Would Have Been Great If The Video Gets Paused While Receiving A Call On Another Device, As This Is Available On Boat Rockerz 335 And A Few Different Boat Neckbands.Cons:-‚Ä¢ It'S Range Is Very Low Considering Bluetooth V5.2, I Even Have Boat Neckband With V5.0 Which Has Better Range. Even A Single Wall Coming In Between 3-4Ms Can Block The Sound Output.‚Ä¢ Its Battery Life Is Average Which Needs Charge Every Day If You Use It For Roughly 8-10 Hours Everyday With Bionic Crystal Mode/Anc Enabled.‚Ä¢ While Using Dual Pairing Sometimes There Are Sound Drops And Lags In Between. And The Sound Gets High Pitched And Starts Lagging Sometimes If You Switch Quickly Between Devices. (This Happened On The Replacement Unit I Received, Maybe It'S Not The Case With Your Unit).‚Ä¢ Sometimes No Sound Is Received While Playing Audio From Both Devices. (I Don'T Know If It'S Wrong With My Unit Or Every Unit.)Overall This Is A Good And Considerable Neckband Under 2K If You Want Good Bass-Rich Sound Quality, Anc/Ambience Mode And Descent Battery Life.But If Your Requirements Mostly Is Dual Pairing, Then This Is Not For You. As I Bought This Considering Dual Pairing Feature Most Importantly. But It'S Not Really Seamless In Between Devices, But Still It'S The Best Possible Available Feature In This Price Range Or Even Under 5K But It Needs Improvements And Fixes To Make It More Seamless And Efficient.Another Problem With Dual Pairing Is That The Media Doesn'T Gets Paused On First Device If There'S A Call On The Second One, Which Is Already There On Boat'S Few Other Neckbands, But Then There Is No Media-Pause Feature On Them. (E.G., If Audio Is Being Played On 2 Devices First Device Audio Will Get Paused If Audio Is Played On Second Device And Vice-Versa).So Do Try It Out By Yourself. Because It'S My Personal Experience With The Neckband, Maybe You Get A Better Experience.Thanks For Reading. Happy Shopping!,Bought This One After Using Rockerz 255 Pro For Over 2 Years Now. Comparing This With That, That One Was Ergonomically Better, Felt Snug In Ears.Standalone Review Of This.1. Noise Cancellation Is Just Alright, Not Too Great, Not Too Bad.2. Sound Quality Is Definitely Great And Excellent With The Bionic Sound Feature. Kudos On That Part.3. Bass Quality Is Fairly Good At This Price Point.4. Holds Charge For As Long As Advertised.5. Overall Bulky Nature Of The Neckband Puts You Off And Then The Finish Is Poor Too Around The Control Buttons Making It Look Very Tacky & Cheap (Atleast On The Funky Grey One Which I Bought Because It Was Priced Lowest).Conclusion:Good Product At A Fair Price I.E. Nothing Too Great But Nothing Bad Either.",Https://M.Media-Amazon.Com/Images/I/31Gzrr9Mias._Sx300_Sy300_Ql70_Fmwebp_.Jpg,Https://Www.Amazon.In/Boat-Rockerz-330-Bluetooth-Assistant/Dp/B092X94Qnq/Ref=Sr_1_55?Qid=1672902997&S=Computers&Sr=1-55

Search For Devices And You'Ll Find 'Boult Audio' Just Tap It And You'Ll Be Paired.Also You Can Hear An Audio That Your Are Being Connected.Battery:The Company Has Not Specified Anything About The Capacity Of The Battery.It States That It Has 12 Hours Of Playback.Yes,The Battery Backup Is Good On This.We Can Easily Get 12Hours Of Play Time Through This Earphones.Additional Features :These Earphones Come With Built In Vibration.Whenever You Receive A Call The Earphones Will Start Vibrating. I Have To Tell You,The Vibration Os Really Strong And Can Easily Be Know Even If You Are In Busy (Like Traveling In Bike,Or A Busy Street)But Remember If You'Re Getting Calls Continuously It'Ll Less The Battery Backup.Sound Quality :Sound Quality In These Earphones Are Amazing.The Mids Are Crisp And Clear, The Vocals Are Good The Bass Is Also Heavy But It'S That Not Punchy.But Don'T You Can Adjust The Equalizer And Have That Punchy Base.The Call Quality Is Also Good Because Of The Condenser Microphone .These Earphones Have Noise Cancellation Which Works Good.The Volume Level On These Earphones Are Really High.I Cannot Go Beyond 80%,Alright. So I Have Been Using Boult Probass Curve For Over A Month And Would Like To Summarize My Feedback In Bullet-Points To Make It Easy For The Prospective Buyers. I Was Thinking To Buy A Quality Bluetooth Headset With A Great Performance At An Affordable Price For Quite Long And This Is Where My Search Ended. I Was Quite Fed Up Of Using Cheap Wired Headsets As They Used To Go Out Of Function Or Get Snapped Every Now And Then. Moreover, I Found Them Getting Entangled Every Other Second Making It Really Inconvenient To Handle Especially While Travelling. Its That Time I Started Feeling The Need Of A Wireless Headset And Began My Search. I Took Good Time (Months) To Look For A Good Product. And, This Is When I Decided To Purchase This Item. Before Purchase I Devoted Time To Read The User'S Reviews (That I Always Do Before Making Any Purchase-Small Or Big) And Found Myself Convinced. Finally, I Decided To Go For It. Ok. So, No More Essay Writing :) Let Me Get Straight To The Key Points:1. I Bought This For 999 Under Sale So Saved Inr 499. (It'S A Good Saving. As Warrent Buffet Says ""Every Penny Saved Is Every Penny Earned"")2. This Has Great Sound Quality. I Could Not Compare It Against Any Other Product Because I Don'T Have Any Other Bluetooth Headset With Me :) But This Will Surely Not Let You Down. It Is Very Loud Even At 80% Volume Level. You Just Cannot Listen To At That Level; Forget About Full Volume. Bass Is Great But Not Outstanding To Be Honest But It Does Not Disappoint Either. Good Thing Is The Sound Does Not Distort Even If You Raise It To 100%. Excellent Sound Clarity!3. I Am Not A Technocrat So Cannot Tell What Are The Characteristics Of Noise Cancellation Feature But You Will Not Get To Hear Any External Sound/Noise Or Very Very Minimal That Is Not Noticeable. So, This Stands Perfect At This Point.4. Performs Excellent While Taking A Call. You Will A Get A Crystal Clear Voice When You Make/Take A Call Using This Device. You Will Feel As If You Are Making Calls Directly From The Mobile Phone. In Fact, It'S Even Better At Times When The Voice From The Other Side Is Low. I Really Love The Hands-Free Calling Because I Have To Take Long Calls With The Clients In My Job.5. Battery Backup Is Excellent!!! It Can Last Anywhere From 10 To 11 Hours. I Have Tested It Rigorously In Both Audio And Video Usage. And, I Mean It. I Tested It For Almost A Month With Day-Wise Log Capture. Please See The Detailed Tracking At The End. It Gets Full Charged In 2 Hours Approx.6. Bluetooth Range Is Good. It Covers A Distance Of 10 To 15 Feet Easily. It'S Quite Enough If Not Good Enough. My Figures May Be Wrong. Beware! It'S Just My Rough Estimate. Haven'T Tested Is Rigorously.7. Design Looks Good And Is Very Convenient To Wear. The Wires Are Adjustable As Per Need. This Is A Nice Thing. Looks Cool When You Wear It Around Your Neck. I Chose Red Color.8. Last But Not The Least. It Comes With 1 Year Replacement Warranty So You Can Sleep Peacefully While Enjoying Your Favorite Music :)Judgement: Just Go For It If You Have A Limited Budget Or Don'T Want To Spend A Fortune On Bluetooth Headset. I Was Hesitant To Spend Anything Beyond 1000 Bucks On A Bluetooth Headset. It Was My Personal Limitation.Ps: Battery Backup Log:16 May 1 Hour 15 Minutes Approx In The Evening Video Play17 May 1 Hour 15 Minutes Approx In The Morning Song Play + Webex Call With Suneel17 May 1 Hour 30 Minutes Approx In The Afternoon Song Play17 May 1 Hour Approx In The Evening Video Play17 May 1 Hour 20 Minutes Approx At Night Video Play20 May 1 Hour 30 Minutes Approx In The Morning Song Play20 May 1 Hour 30 Minutes Approx In The Evening Video Play21 May 1 Hour 30 Minutes Approx In The Morning Song Play21 May Start 22 Minutes Approx Video Play In The Eveningbattery Deadtotal Battery Time 11 Hour 12 Minutes*****************************************************22 May 1 Hour 35 Minutes Approx In The Morning Song Play22 May 1 Hour Approx In The Evening Video Play23 May 1 Hour 35 Minutes Approx In The Morning Song Play23 May 1 Hour Approx In The Evening Video Play24 May 1 Hour 30 Minutes Approx In The Morning Song Play24 May 1 Hour 10 Minutes Approx In The Evening Video Play26 May 27 Minutes Approx In The Evening Video Play27 May 1 Hour 29 Minutes Approx In The Morning Song Play27 May 1 Hour 27 Minutes Approx In The Evening Video Playtotal Time 11 Hr 13 Minutes*******************************************************28 May 1 Hour 46 Minutes Approx In The Morning Song Play28 May 1 Hour 17 Minutes Approx In The Evening Video Play29 May 1 Hour 57 Minutes Approx In The Morning Song Play29 May 1 Hour In The Evening Video Play30 May 1 Hour 48 Minutes Approx In The Morning Song Play30 May 55 Minutes Approx In The Evening Video Play31 May 1 Hour 24 Minutes Approx In The Morning Song Play10 Hour 07 Minutesbattery Discharged***************************************************31 May 1 Hour 12 Minutes Approx In The Evening Video Play03 June 1 Hour 38 Minutes Approx Song Play In The Morning03 June 1 Hour 17 Minutes Approx Video Play In The Evening04 June 1 Hour 28 Minutes Approx Song Play In The Morning04 June 1 Hour 11 Minutes Approx Video Play In The Evening05 June 23 Minutes Approx Video Play At Night06 June 1 Hour 47 Minutes Approx Song Play In The Morning06 June 50 Minutes Approx Video Play In The Eveningtotal Time 9 Hour 46 Minutesbattery Discharged******************************************************07 June 8.34 Am Start Song Play 10.06 End 1 Hour 32 Minutes Approx07 June 6.47 Pm Start Video Play 7.53 Pm End 1 Hour 10 Minutes Approx08 June 11.38Am Start Song Play 12.37 59 Minutes Approx End 2.16Pm Start Song Play 4.04 Pm 1 Hour 48 Minutes Approx End10 June 8.37 Am Start Song Play 10.14 Am End 1 Hour 37 Minutes Approx10 June 6.27 Pm Start Video Play 7.46Pm End 1 Hour 19 Minutes Approx11 June 9.10Am Start Song Play 10.51Am End 1 Hour 41 Minutes Approx11 June 6.55 Pm Video Play 7.46Pm End 51 Minutes Approxbatter Dischargedtotal Time 10 Hour 57 Minutes Approx,You Have To Purchase A Headphone I Recommend For This One.

It Would Be Wrong To Expect Great Sound From An Overall Product. You Cant Have Everything At Once. This Is My Personal Opinion, Since I Am A Music Enthusiast And Have Experienced Music From Great Headphones And Ear Phones.Other Than That Its Worth Trying, Totally Recommend This Product If You Daily Travel For Work And You Are Looking For A Budget Wireless Earphone,Sound Quality Is Not Best,I Liked This Product.

It Is Sturdy But A Bit On Heavier Side. Can Charge Three Phones At A Time If You Use The Two Usb And Third Type C Port As Well For Charging. The Speed Of Charging Is Alright And Appropriate. The One And Only Drawback I Experienced Is The Weight Of The Power-Bank Itself, Without This Limitation It Could Be Really Amazing Product To Buy.,Bit Heavy But Does It‚ÄôS Job. Takes Tooooooo Much Time To Charge. Whatever Mention In The Description Is Not Correct At All With Regards To The Powerbank Charging.,I Needed An Extra Power Bank With A Larger Capacity.

When I First Received This Power Bank It Came In A Small Box (Approx 12X9X3Cm, Mfg: Aug 2019) With Everything Forced In Congested Space. The Issue I Had In This One Was That It Came With Open Seal & No Poly Wrap Around Product Box As If It Was A Used Product Or Was Tampered In Between. So Was Skeptical About The Authenticity Of The Product And Ordered A Replacement Right Away.‚Üí This One Had Usb C Cable But No Carry Pouch.2. When Replacement Came, It Came In A Poly-Wrapped Bigger Box (22X10X4 Cm, Mfg: Oct 2019) With An Outer Sleeve And Main Box Inside With A Hologram Seal. Maybe Ambrane Changed The Packaging. The Hologram Seal Here Was Intact But Was Also Not Applied Properly To Secure The Opening. Looked Like It Was Applied With An Open Box. So Its Presence Was Useless.‚Üí This One Came With Micro Usb Cable And A Carry Pouch.‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢üëú Carry Pouch‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Üí As Per My Analysis Carry Pouch Comes With The Latest October Lot Which Comes In A Bigger Box And Was Unavailable In Earlier Lot With A Small Box.‚Üí Carry Pouch Size Was Appropriate For Power Bank And I Had No Trouble Inserting Power Bank In It. (Some Users Reported It Having A Smaller Opening But I Had No Trouble With It And Found It To Be A Proper Fit. Neither Loose Nor Tight.‚Üí Its Soft Nylon Meshed Pouch And Is A Nice Addon.‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢üèÜ Verdict‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚ñ∂ At The Price Point Its Not A Bad Deal.

For This Thing Only, 10 Days Replacement Policy From Amazon And 1-Year Warranty From Ambrame Is Available.‚ñ∂ If One Can Extend The Budget By A Few Hundred, Mi Power Bank Will Be A Better Option With A Metallic Body & Better Quality Overall. I Have Mi, Honor & Ambrane Power Bank And Their Overall Rating Will Be (From Low To High) Ambrane ‚Üí Honor ‚Üí Mi,I Am Putting Up This Review After 1 Day Of Usage. This Is The Second Power Bank I Have Bought From Ambrane India Overall Third Power Bank For My Family. Before To This I Have Bought Their Pp-30 30000 Mah Model And Also Has Mi 2I 20000 Mah Power Bank Both Were Really Good, Here I Am Putting Together All The Pros And Cons Which I Am Able To Find After 1 Day Of Usage And Also A Little Bit Of Comparison. My Dad Uses Redmi Note 7, My Mom Has Mi A1 And I Am Using Redmi Note 3Pros:-- Dual Input Type C And Micro Usb This Is The Foremost And Primary Reason Of Choosing This Power Bank Over Mi Or Other Brands As You Don'T Need To Carry Two Cables If Your Phone Has Type C Input Which In My Family 2 Out Of 3 Has  The Same- Easy To Carry And Hold As It Is Very Compact Is Size I Must Say In Comparison To Mi Or Ambrane Pp-30- Solid And Sturdy Built- 20000 Mah Capacity With Same Lithium Polymer Batteries These Are Safer Then Lithium Ion Batteries, This I Came To Know While Buying This Product-  ‚Çπ200 Cheaper Price Than Mi- Touch Button At The Top To Know The Power Status (This Is Something Unique)-  It Took Less Than 1 Hour To Charge My Redmi Note 3 From 13% To 100% At 2 Cell Battery Indicator, Which Is Pretty Good And Almost Equivalent To My Wall Charger Best Part Same Time And Charging Speed In Delhi Metro- I Don'T Know Either It Is Pro Or Con, Both Of My Other Power Banks Supports Qualcomm Quick Charge 3.0 Technology While This Power Bank Supports Only Fast Charging At 2.4 Amp, But I Feel This Has Charged My Phone Better And Faster Than Mi Power Bank Itself. I Know A Phone Must Also Supports Quick Charge Technology For Fast Charging But When I Use Quick Charge On My Dad'S Redmi Note 7 (Which Supports Qc 4.0) Either From Mi Power Bank Or Ambrane Pp-30 Power Bank It Kind Of Heats Up The Phone, Also It Fluctuates The Power And Automatically Switches Between Quick Charge And Fast Charging Which Affects Your Battery Life, So It Is Safer To Charge The Phone At Optimum Current At 2.4 Ampcons:-- Very Stuffy Packaging, It Looks Like The Power Bank Has Been Forced Fully Stuffed Inside The Box- It Has Some Adhesive Tape At The Top I Don'T Know Why ? Which, When You Remove It, Puts Scratches On The Top, Be Careful While Removing The Same- No Torch Light, Their Pp-30 Have It- Only Micro Cable Inside The Box,Definitely Heavy But I Knew This.

After Getting It Checked I Found Out That The Issue Was In The Ups (Maybe Wiring Cable) Which Stopped Transmission.I Contacted The Customer Care And I Was Assisted By Mr. Ankit. He Was Very Helpful And Asked Me To Demonstrate The Issue In Video And Tried To Ascertain The Issue Through Other Checkups Too. After Ascertaining That The Issue Is In The Product He Confirmed To Get The Default Product Replaced And Started The Issue And Informed Me On Tentative Timelines For The Same. Hoping To Receive The Replacement Soon So That I Can Continue Uninterrupted Internet !!,I Have Been Using This Product For The Past Four Months, During This Tenure I Had Faced No Issues Initially But Roughly After 3 Months The Power Back Up Started Shrinking Extremely And The Least Duration Was Under 30 Minutes, That‚ÄôS When I Contacted The Customer Support Via Whatsapp And I Must Say The Whole Experience With The Customer Support Team Was Simply Surprising. They Were Very Polite And Helpful Throughout The Process. It Was Very Easy For Me To Explain The Issue To Them Then At The End Of The First Conversation Itself They Arranged A Replacement For The Product Since It Is Just 3-4 Months Old. They Took All The Responsibility Of The Issue And Sent Me A New Product Which I Am Currently Using, Now The Back Up I Am Getting Is 4+ Hours Which Is Based On My Usage.So Finally I Am Not Sure How Often I Buy A Product From This Brand But I Will Never Forget The Support I Received From This This Brand. Cheers!!!,I Purchased The Product 10 Days Back And Initial Product Was Not Working Properly. But I Received A Replacement For That. Thanks For Immediate Response From The Support Team. I Liked Oakter Because It'S Indian Product And Not A Chinese. As Of Now It'S Working Fine And No Lag In Wi-Fi Connection Or Speed. Need To Test The Recharge Capacity When The Power Goes Off. Will Keep You Updated After A Month Again By Checking The Results. Giving 4 Stars As Of Now.,This Is A Really Good Option For Those Who Are Primarily Concerned About Being Cut Off From Online Meetings/Calls Due To Frequent Short Term Power Cuts, And Are Not Willing To Spend More Amount Buying An Inverter. I Have Been Using This Product Since Around 3 Months And Am Pretty Happy With Its Backup.,I Have Been Using The Product For More Than A Year. Later I Purchased A Second Product For My Parents Home And It Was Working Fine For 6 Months. However The Backup Battery Stopped Working Later And The Customer Support Team Were Quick To Respond And Swiftly Sent Me The Replacement Product.,Product Was Delivered Very Promptly And Packaging Was Good. Using This Product Just From Couple Of Days And Its Working As Expected. Very Easy To Plug & Use. Reserving 1 Star For Longevity Of This Product, Will Revise My Rating After A Year Or So Depending On My Experience.,The Device Doesn'T Support For 4 Hours. It Support Only For 2 Or 2 Hours 30 Minutes Max On Full Recharge.Product Is Affordable, Light And Good. Please Don'T Fool On 4 Hours Support Capacity. Resonate Ups Is Better As Compared  To This.,This Product Claims To Give Backup For Upto 4Hours. But It Wont Even Give Backup For 30 Mins. I Claimed Warranty And Got The New Product As Well Still The Same Problem. They Reiterate And Say Upto 4 Hours Where They Shud Mention Clearly That It Will Give Backup Upto 1 Hour Not More Than That.One Of The Worst Customer Support Services I Have Seen. The Associates Keep Repeating The Same Sentence Or Copy Paste The Chat And Dont Provide Solutions. Totally Disappointed And Waste Of Money.

If You Are Using It In Addition To Your Isp Provided Modem-Router, I Would Suggest Using It In The Access Point Mode Only.The Range And The Speeds Are Working Better Than I Expected For The Price -- Certainly Better Than The Router That The Isp Provides. The Router Does Come With A Lan Cable, But The Quality Of The Cable Is Not Very Confidence Inspiring. The Leds On The Front Can Be Configured Via The Tether App To Switch Off At Specific Times, Which Is A Neat Feature. Apart From That, I Have Found Tether App To Be Pretty Useless. It Doesn'T Specify The Device Identity For Some Reason, Just Shows The Ip And ""Unknown"", Until You Rename The Device Yourself. Sometimes It Doesn'T Even List All The Devices Connected. I Guess It Is Better To Use The Router Settings From The Browser Itself If You Want To Dig Into The Settings.I Would Like To Add One More Thing In The End.

That'S Just Plain Uncomfortable To Me.Also The Build Feels Very Flimsy And Plastic-Ky.Also A Major Drawback I Felt Was That Whenever We Switch On/Off We Get The Built-In Audio!,Bought It For 1499. Now After 2 Years 2 Months, Today It Broke. After 6 Months Of Use, The Red Coating Started Peeling Off. But Device Showed No Problems. Sound Is Clear, Balanced, Not Very Hogh But Enough Bass, Good Battery Backup, Charges Faster, Aux Is Available. Disadvantage Is You Can'T Fold It. Planning To Buy It Again, As I Think This The Best In Segment. Now The Rate Has Increased To 1799.,The First Thing I Want To Say Is That The Headphone Is Really Bulky. I Didn'T Notice The First Few Days Of Using But Eventually It Gives Pain On The Shoulder If Worn For A Longer Period Of Time (3-4 Hours), Sound Quality Is Good. Do Not Have Any Bass, Anc Is Not Present In This Headphone. It'S A Decent Headphone For Casual Purposes. If You'Re A Music Lover Or Wear Your Headset For Longer Period Of Time Then I Think You Should Invest In Other Options, Which Is Light Weight And Have Anc In Them.,Everything Is Great About Boat Products. Delivered In Two Days.Noise Cancelling Is Great. Bluetooth Connectivity Is Good. Something It Takes Time To Connect. If You Planning To Buy Then This Would Be A Great Choice.,In Details It Was Written That It Has Physical Noise Isolation Feature In It  But When It Came I Didn'T Observe As Such Feature I Bought It For Study Purpose That The Reason Why I Was Looking For Such Feature But I Found It As A Waste Of Money.,Sometimes .. Sound Doesn'T Work .. You Have To Decrease The Volume To Zero And Then Increase Again To Hear The Sound. Bu This Happens Only 1 Out Of 10 Times.,Build Quality Is Good, Has Physical Noice Isolation, Soft Padded, Comfortable, But Bass Could Be Quite Better, Otherwise Everything Is Fine,Best For Gym, Study, Online Lectures, Entertainment Etc.Please Go For It ü•Çüëçüèª,Good Quality Headphones In Over The Ear Category. Good Quality Sound But Has Less Bass As Other Says But It'S Decent. Good Mic Quality For Meetings But Doesn'T Have Any Noise-Cancellation Feature.

Marketing Fluff Aside, How Do The Earphones Really Sound? Simply Put: Surprisingly Decent For Earphones That Cost Less Than A Nice Dinner For Two.While Most Earphones In This Price Range Have Over-Inflated Bass That Dominates The Rest Of The Frequency Range, The Bass Response On The Mi Earphones Is Controlled And Restrained. It Doesn'T Overwhelm The Sound Signature Or Smother The Highs. That Said, Bassheads Will Be Left Slightly Wanting.It'S Surprising To Hear That Highs Are Present And Distinct In The Sound Mix, Although They Do Get Overpowering Sometimes. The Mids Are Slightly Repressed, Which Is Evident In Vocal-Heavy Genres Such As Blues. While The Clarity On Offer Is Decent For The Price, Songs With Many Layers Of Instrumentation Do Sound Muffled And Noisy. This Is Most Evident In Complex Genres Such As Rock And Metal In Which The Earphones Sound Harsh And The Mids Get Buried By The Treble And Bass.,This Earphone Set Is Fantastic.

The Boat Xtend Smartwatch Comes With A Stylish Design Resembling The Apple Watch. Moreover, It Has Built-In Amazon Alexa Support, Spo2 Tracking, Stress Tracking, And Much More. Coming In A Budget Segment, Is It Worth It? Should You Buy This Smartwatch? If You Too Have Such Queries, Then There Is Nothing To Worry About. It Is A Detailed Review Of Boat Xtend Smartwatch Which Will Clear All Your Doubts About It.Contentsbox Contentdesign, Build & Comfortdisplaywatch Ui And Featuresalexa Supportwatch Facesboat Wave Appaccuracybatteryfinal Wordsbuy Now:Box Contentboat Xtend Box Contentsmartwatch In Black&Gold Colourcharging Clipuser Manual And Warranty Carddesign, Build & Comfortwhen Buying A Smartwatch, One Always Thinks About Its Design And Look. Apart From Features, Design And Build Is Another Major Aspect One Should Take Care Of When Buying A Smartwatch. The Boat Has Worked On Its Design This Time Which Brings It To A Premium Side In Terms Of Look. The Design Is Inspired By The Apple Watch 3, But It Cannot Be Compared To That. Obviously, In Every Aspect, Apple Watch 3 Would Be Much Better Than The Boat Xtend Smartwatch. Redmi Watch As Well As Amazfit Bip U Pro Has The Same Shape And Design, But The Build Quality Is Much Premium On This One.Boat Xtend Design And Buildi Personally Don‚ÄôT Like The Color Scheme Of This Boat Xtend Smartwatch. The Black Color Variant Comes With A Golden Color Metallic Frame. I Believe The Gold Color Would Fade Away After Some Time. There Are Three Other Color Variants, Which Also Don‚ÄôT Look Stylish As This One. However, That Is My Personal Opinion On The Color Scheme, So Maybe You Might Find The Color Scheme To Be Good.Boat Xtend Designthe Watch Has 5Atm Water Resistance. It Has Silicon Straps, Which Are Quite Comfortable. The Straps Are Good Quality Straps Which You Will Find Comfortable With Regular Usage.Displaycoming To The Display, The Watch Has A 42Mm Square Shape Display. What You See On This One Is A Tft Panel. The Screen Has Big Bezels, However, The Good Part Is That The Screen Goes Completely Back When It Is Off, So You Won‚ÄôT Notice The Bezels, And The Screen Quality Won‚ÄôT Feel Cheap At All. It Doesn‚ÄôT Have An Always-On Display, But We Cannot Complain About That. The Watch Offers A Screen On Time Of Up To 20 Seconds And Up To 12 Levels Of Brightness Control.Boat Xtend Display Qualityi Find The Display Quality Of The Boat Xtend Smartwatch To Be Better Than The Previous Smartwatch From Boat. View Angle Is Good On This One, And You Can Clearly See Content On This Smartwatch Even In The Sunlight. The Color On This One Is Not Very Saturated, But This Isn‚ÄôT Something That We Can Complain About In This Price Range.Watch Ui And Featuresthe Ui Of This Smartwatch Is Clean And Easy To Use. There Is A Single Button On The Watch Which Works As The Power/Off Button As Well As The Back Button. Moreover, The Display Is A Touchscreen Display That Works Without Any Problem. There Isn‚ÄôT Much Animation On The Bar Menu, And The Navigation Is Simple, So You Won‚ÄôT Find It Difficult To Use. However, The Watch May Lag A Bit. The Company Has Done Cost-Cutting In Terms Of The Processor, That‚ÄôS Why You May Find It To Lag A Bit, But It Is Ok, And Not A Big Deal At The Price Point You Get It.Boat Xtend Uithe Watch Offers All The Basic Fitness Features Such As Daily Activity (Which Includes Total Steps Walked, Calories Burnt, And Time), Heart Rate, Sleep Tracking, Stress Tracking Breath Training, Spo2 Training, Meditation, Find My Phone, And Music Control. Apart From That, There Are 14 Different Support Modes On This Watch. I Tried A Few Of Them, And They Worked Fine. The Watch Notifies You Of The Incoming Calls, Messages Received, And Various Other Notifications In Detail.Boat Xtend Smartwatch Reviewalexa Supportthe Main Highlight Of The Boat Xtend Is The Amazon Alexa Support. The Watch Has An In-Built Microphone, And You Can Access It By Long-Pressing The Back Button. Do Note That You Can Only Do Some Basic Tasks With Alexa On The Watch Like Setting An Alarm, Setting A Timer, And Such. Well, It Is A Good Thing To Have Alexa On A Watch, But You Won‚ÄôT Find It Very Useful. Probably You Will Use It For A Day Or Two Out Of Excitement, And Then You Won‚ÄôT Prefer Using It Because It Only Does Some Basic Tasks. So, Even If Boat Missed This Feature, It Won‚ÄôT Be A Problem.Boat Xtend Alexa Supportwatch Facesthe Next Cool Thing About This Boat Smartwatch Is The Watch Faces You Get On This One. You Get More Than 100 Watch Faces On The Watch, And Probably More Watch Faces Will Be Added To It. Moreover, You Can Also Set A Custom Watch Face As Well.Boat Xtend Watch Facesboat Wave Appyou Will Have To Download The Boat Wave App To Use The Watch. The App Is Available For Both Android As Well As Ios Devices. You Won‚ÄôT Be Seeing Bugs On The App, And It Works Perfectly. I Haven‚ÄôT Noticed Any Problem With Connectivity Like Frequent Disconnection. The Interface Of The Boat Wave Is Clean And Simple. You Will Get All The Fitness-Related Options And All The Watch Settings On The App Itself.Boat Xtend Boat Wave Appaccuracyaccuracy Is One Of The Important Aspects That One Should Take Care Of When Buying A Smartwatch. So Talking About The Accuracy, I Tested Everything On This Watch, From Normal Walking To Running, Sleeping, And Much More, And I Find The Results To Be Accurate.Boat Xtend Accuracy Testcompared To Realme Or Redmi Watch, The Result Was The Same On All Of Them. So, There Is No Problem With The Accuracy. I Don‚ÄôT Find The Results To Be Accurate On Most Of The Budget Fitness Trackers, But Yes, This Smartwatch Is Accurate In Terms Of Fitness Tracking, Sleep Tracking, And Everything It Does.Boat Xtend Accuracycomparing It To The Noise Watch Which We Tried Recently, The Stress Level As Well As The Spo2 Tracking Is Much More Accurate On This One. It Also Has The Option To Track The Menstrual Cycle In Women.Boat Xtend Accuracybatteryyou Get To See A 300Mah Battery On This One, Which The Company Claims To Last 7 Days. However, If You Use Most Of The Features Of The Watch, Then The Battery Will Last About Two And A Half Days. If You Keep The Brightness Low, Then The Battery Will Last About 3-4 Days. I Find The Battery Life To Be A Downside Of The Watch. It Comes With Magnet Hook Charging Support.Final Wordsboat Xtend Smartwatch Is A Decent Smartwatch From The Boat. It Offers All The Basic Fitness Features You Will Find On A Budget Fitness Tracker, A Good Display, Alexa Support, Good Design And Build, And Much More. The Smartwatch At This Price Is Quite Good. Personally, What I Didn‚ÄôT Like About This Smartwatch Is Its Color Scheme. However, If You Like The Color Scheme, Then I Would Recommend You To Go For It. Overall The Watch Is Good With Nothing To Dislike About It Except For The Battery Life. The Battery Life On This One Is Quite Low. The Company Claims It To Have A Battery Life Of 7 Days, But With Regular Usage, It Will Last For 2-3 Days. If You Are Looking For A Good Smartwatch Under Rs.5000, And You Can Adjust With The Battery Life, And You Like The Color Scheme, Then I Would Recommend You To Go For This Smartwatch. It Offers All The Features That Should Be There In A Smartwatch Under Rs.5000.,Pros:1. Premium Build Quality With Matte Finishing- Sturdy Polycarbonate Frame, Good Soft Silicone Straps That R Absolutely Flush With The Body Of The Watch. Attractive, Trendy Colours.2. Heart Rate (Except Heart Rate Spikes In Weight Training), Pedometer(Steps Counter) Are Accurate But Spo2 Is Off By +/- 2% When Compared To Pulse Oximeter Readings. But Most Smart Watches Offer The Same Accuracy. Sleep Tracking Is Accurate Only For Bed Time & Wake Up Time, Duration But Stages Of Sleep Are Inaccurate. Light, Deep Sleep, Waking Detected But No Rem Sleep Detected. Sleep Data From The Watch Synchronises Smoothly With Boat Wave App. Issues Warning Msg If Watch Not Worn On Hand Properly And Does Not Detect Data Of Surfaces.3. Large (1.69""), Clear Bright, Sharp Lcd Ips Display Even In The Sun.4. Touch Not Smooth, Experienced Jitters. Ui Also Lags At Times & After Attaching The Tempered Glass Sometimes Some Functions Require 02-03 Taps To Work. But Acceptable Scrolling Response If Finger Moved Diagonally Instead Of Vertically.5. In App Gps Works Superbly. Excellent Route Tracking On The Map. This Feature Is Not Advertised In Their Description.6. Bluetooth 5.0 Connectivity Is Good If Mobile Is Kept In Close Proximity(7M). The Boat Wave App Must Remain Running In The Background At All Times.7. Definitely Splash Proof Though Did'Nt Take The Risk Of Submerging The Watch.8. All Notifications Are Working, No Problem With Call Alerts Or Sms Msgs Or Social Media App Notifications. No Lags At All Though There Is Provision For A 3 Sec Lag Which Can Be Turned On.9. Alexa Works Superbly But Since There Is No Speaker, Info Is Displayed On The Screen. My Wipro Smart Bulb, Firetv Stick Can Be Controlled Easily Using The Inbuilt Alexa On The Watch. Alexa Can Do Mathematical Calculations, Currency Conversions, Even Foreign Language Translations, Apart From Supplying Info On Anything Under The Sun. But Ofcourse, Alexa Cannot Make Calls. Alexa Can Set Alarm, Timer Also.10. Sedentary Alert, Drinking Water Reminder, Stress Alert, Menstrual Cycle Alert, Alarms, Timers Function Well.11. Boat Wave App Connects Easily & No Lags Observed. Data Syncs Smoothly With Google Fit App. Excellent Health Reports And Motivational Rewards System In The Form Of Badges.

The Rest Can Be Changed From The Boat Wave App.Cons:1. Lacks Vibration Intensity Control.2. Lacks Camera Control Shutter. But Can'T Figure Out Its Use As My Handset Accepts Both Voice Commands & Gestures To Click Pics.3. No Quick Reply Messages For Notifications/Call Alerts.4. No Call Acceptance Or Silencing Feature. A Work Around Can Be If Bluetooth Handset Is Connected At The Same Time.5. Spo2 Is Not Accurate And Sometimes Freezes At 97%. But This Is Common In All Smart Watches.6. Battery Does'Nt Last More Than 03 Days If Continuous Hr Measurement Is Turned On. Otherwise Easily Lasts For 7 Days.7. Watch Faces Are Very Childish. Expected Better Quality Designs. Company Can Easily Improve On This In Their Next Update.8. Amazon Prime Only Replacement, No Refund Policy Is Not Good. At Least Colour Change Should Be Allowed Once.9. Music Control Feature Does Not Display The Title Of The Song.10. No Bp Monitoring Or Temperature Monitoring Feature. Smart Watches Usually Do Not Provide Reliable Bp Data.11. No Calling Feature. But It Does'Nt Matter As Most Don'T Want Conversations To Be Public.12. A Bit Large For Narrow Wrists, Band @22 Mm Is A Bit Wide.13. Company Should Provide A Tempered Glass Protector. No Mention Of Protective Glass On The Display Mentioned. Have Attached A Scot Tempered Glass Purchased Separately.14. There Are Actually Only 10 Sports Modes. Boat Has Bloated The List With Indoor-Outdoor Combi Of 4 Sports (Walking, Running, Swimming, Cycling).15. There Is No Light Sensor. Auto Brightness Is Only Time Dependant But Works Well.Was A Wedding Anniversary Gift For My Wife Who Liked It Very Much Even The Colour- The Evergreen, Classic Gold-Black. Overall The Best Smart Watch With Alexa Built In, Available At The Budget Price Point Of Under Rs 3000. An Excellent Fitness Tracker But Average Health Monitor.,üëç,Plz Add Calling Feature With This,Otherwise It Is Ok,Good,It'S Little Expensive But Okkk,",Https://M.Media-Amazon.Com/Images/I/41Pfjyupzll._Sx300_Sy300_Ql70_Fmwebp_.Jpg,Https://Www.Amazon.In/Boat-Smartwatch-Multiple-Monitoring-Resistance/Dp/B096Vf5Yyf/Ref=Sr_1_100?Qid=1672903000&S=Computers&Sr=1-100

Else This Just Works Fine.,I Recently Purchased The Boat Airdopes 181 In-Ear True Wireless Earbuds And Have Been Using Them For The Past Week. Overall, I Am Satisfied With The Product. The Earbuds Are Comfortable To Wear And Have A Good Fit, And The Sound Quality Is Impressive For The Price Point.However, I Was Disappointed To Discover That The Earbuds Do Not Have Noise Cancellation As Advertised. While They Do Block Out Some Ambient Noise, They Are Not As Effective As Other Earbuds I'Ve Used With Noise Cancellation Technology.The Battery Life Has Been Satisfactory. The Earbuds Last For A Good Amount Of Time On A Single Charge, And The Case Is Convenient For Charging On The Go.Overall, I Would Recommend The Boat Airdopes 181 Earbuds For Those Looking For A Budget-Friendly Option With Good Sound Quality. Just Be Aware That They Do Not Have Noise Cancellation.,I Am Writing This Review After Two Days Of Usage.1. Sound Quality: The Lows Are Good And Pleasing To The Ears. Bass Quality Is Good. I Just Felt Like The Treble Is A Little Too High Which Makes The High Frequency Music Sound A Bit Unpleasant. Overall The Quality Is Okay But Not As Good As A Wired Headset Or Neckband Earphones. (Kaam Chal Jayga)2. Battery Backup: It'S Been 2 Days And I Haven'T Charged It Yet....Still Showing 70+% Of Battery Remaining. So I Don'T Think Battery Backup Would Be A Problem. (Moderate Usage)3. Built: The Case Is Small And Handy. It Feels Sturdy. The Buds Fit Well In The Ears. Overall Built Is Good.4. Latency: This One'S For Gamers. I Am Actually Impressed By The Low Latency It Has. Even Without Turning On The 'Beast Mode', The Feedback Is Almost Instantaneous. And After Turning On The Beast Mode, It Becomes Flawless. I Played Bgmi And Cod And Didn'T Feel Any Lag In The Sound.5. Calling: I Tried Calling In A Silent Atmosphere And There Was No Problem Faced. Will Update You Guys If There Turns Out To Be A Problem When Calling In A Crowded Area.,In 1399 Rupees It Is A Good Earphones. Good Battary Life, Good Sound, Good Connectivitycons- Very Poor Build Quality, Feel So Cheap.

Once You Disconnect, Depending On Any Other Headset You Will Have To Go Back To These Settings And Disable Content Protected Device.

Sometimes If I Stop The Video App And Restart Then It Will Be No Lag.I Don'T Use Zoom,Teams,Skype, So I Cannot Test How The Mic Setup Would Function.Any One That Has Any Input For This Please Use Any Or All Of My Post And Add To It. This Would Be Helpful To Alot Of People.*First Post* So For A Few Months I Was Using It Strictly Thru Win10 Utilizing Win10 Drivers And Bluetooth Connection Page Thru Settings/System. But A Few Times I Tried To Use With Music Streaming To Sony Xb400 Or Oneplus Buds Wireless Bass Edition And There Would Be Intermittant Drops. Also When It Came To Pairing And Connecting It Would Consistanly Slow Down My Hp Amd A6 Chipset Laptop. Also Anytime I Took The Dongle Out It Would Also Affect Disconnect My Thumbdrive. So I Assumed It Was A Throttling Going On With My Usb Ports. I Have Sandisk Dual Drive, Wd Passport, Dvi To Hdmi And Logitech Dongle. So One By One I Disconnected Everything And Left The Bt Dongle And It Was A Little Better.So I Checked The Tp Link India Site For Any Faq Related. When I Searched In The Downloads->Drivers Section There Was Software Driver Present.  So I Downloaded, Installed It And Win10 Taskbar Shows Bt Icon To Use Thebt Dongle. The Driver Software Is By Csr Harmony Wireless Software Stack Version 2.1.63.0.Once Installed There Are More Options That Can Be Accessed Thru The Bt Icon In Taskbar. The Bt Icon Sits In The System Tray As Before. Audio Transmission Can Be Switched Between Stereo And Mono. Also If Your Playing A Video Or Audio File And You Start The Pairing Process Once Connected There Will Be Slight Pause Then It Connects To The Output In Stereo. It Works Really Well, I Purchased A Long Usb Male To Female Cable And Now I Have A Little Bit More Increase In Connection Distance. I Have Not Tried This For Transfer Of Files. If And When I Find A Need To Do So I Will Update.For Now, At This Price Point It Gives Me Freedom To Connect My Bt Audio Gear Instead Of Purchasing A More Expensive Unit To Give My Laptop Bt Capabilites. And This Is As Small If Not Smaller Than Some Thumbdrives. Oh And I Also Purchased A Seperate Qz Powered Usb Hub For My Drives. So The Only Usb Devices Connected Are The Dongle, And The Hub. Now When I Disconnect The Bt Dongle My Drives Stay Connected.I Hope This Information Is Helpful, I Tried Not To Make It Too Long But It Happened. If Any Questions Arise Please Drop Me A Line And I Will Respond With Whatever Help I Can Give.,Tp Link Products Usually Work Well...While Longevity With Continuous Use May Vary, But These Devices Are Not Intended For Prolonged Or Continuous Use..I Have Had Multiple To Link Devices Ranging From Wifi Adapters, Routers, Range Extenders, Etc..Now I Have Tried This Bluetooth Adapter..Pros:-Minuscule Size, You Can Keep Attached To The Device, Not Noticeablebut Not Recommended To Do So..As It'S Usually Set To Discoverable During Setup And It Has Decent Range..So If One Is Too Skeptical, Might Lead To Security Issues.. Although The Hacker Will Have To Be In The Same House Probably!Range Is Decent..Works Good In The Same Room..This Kind Of Device Is Usually Meant For Local Connectivity, Usually Without Barriers...I Use It To Connect Headphones To The Pc And It Works Nicely For That..I Earlier Had A Bluetooth 2.0 Adapter From Enter And That Worked Well Too, Except For The Range And Bandwidth Required Nowadays Has Increased..So Some Choppy Audio Did Occur With Today'S High Quality Audios And That Got Managed With This Bluetooth 4.0 Adapter..Nice Clean Audio..Lastly, It Works Nicely With Linux..I Use Debian Based Ubuntu..And Its Almost Plug And Play..I Did Have Blueman Bluetooth Manager Installed From The Previous Adapter I Had.. And When I Plugged It In..I Didn'T Have To Do Anything Else..So Unlike What The Site Says, About Only Windows, It Definitely Works With Linux..I Can'T Say If The 5.0 Version Ub500 Will Work Though...While Installing The Driver In Windows, I Noticed It Was Installing Csr Stackand Csr Original Chip ( There Are Many Fake Ones) Is Known To Work With Linux..So Maybe That'S Why It Worked Well..Coming To Windows, I Have Win7.I Had Bluesoleil Pre-Installed, And It Worked With It.Didn'T Have To Install Any Driver Separately..But There Is A Driver Available In Their Site For Xp/7..In Win8 And Above, It'S Supposed To Be Plug And Play..So No Issues There..Now The Cons:-A Bit High Price Than Rest Of The Companies.. Probably Can Improve On That....I Bought It For 400Audio Quality Is Good, But Somehow, Compared To My Enter Bluetooth 2.0 Stack..The Audio Was A Bit Muted..Had To Increase The Volume Higher To Reach The Same Level Of Loudness..But Even Then, I Feel, A Slight Reduction In The Dynamic Range Of The Audio.. No Idea If That'S A Software Or Hardware Issue..Encoding/Decoding Issue..It'S Not Very Noticeable.. Specially Of Someone Doesn'T Have Anything To Compare With..Lastly, The Windows Driver Is 400 Mb!Granted It Has Both 32 And 64 Versions..But Each One Is Almost 200 Mb!Thats Way To Big For A Driver Of These Devices..Neither Bluesoleil/Blueman Cross 30Mb..So I Don'T Know What Is Being Packaged In Those Drivers..Also, Somehow The Driver Didn'T Have A Clean Install In My System, Something To Do With Incorrect Loading Of C++ Library...It Didn'T Matter As I Already Had Another Driver Installed..Overall A Nifty Little Device.I Have No Need For 5.0 Bluetooth As I Don'T Have Any Device That Requires It..I Just Needed A 4.0 Adapter To Solve The Bandwidth Problem..And That Purpose Is Nicely Served And That It Works Both In Win And Linux Is Very Helpful..Does The Job Well, Few Conshence One Star Less..,Using It For 2 Weeks. Just Plug It , Install Drivers And You Are Good To Go ! Seem Less Connection With Ps5 Controller! Latency Is Very Low Around 1Ms . So Basically Connection Is Even Faster Than Wired Connection (2Ms) .  But When I Simultaneously Connect Airpods Gen 2 The Sound Output Was Very Weak , It Was Muffled! But It Serves My Main Purpose With Ps5 Controller .,Apparently, It Seems Like Its The Most Relevant Bluetooth Adapter Out There Good Connectivity And All Sort Of Stuffs Like That, Generally Comes In A Bt Adapters I'D Say The Only Con Is The Installation Part It Took A While Figure Out Which Was Their Website And Drivers Of Ub500 Aside From This Everything Is Fabulous.,Very Easy To Install, Connectivity Is Also Good But Sometimes While Using Bluetooth Earphones Sound Cracks Also Bluetooth Sharing Is Quite Slow .....That'S All*Otherwise Th Product Is Very Good*,1) Easy To Install, I Mean Just Plug In .2) Connectivity Is On All Point But 1-2 Time I Feel Fumble Issues.3) Sound Quality Is All Depends On Your Wireless Speaker.,If You Are Tight Budget, It'S Okay Then. Otherwise If Can Spend 150/- Extra, Go For Bt 5.0 Version. Much Better In Both Range And Connectivity.,Like",Https://M.Media-Amazon.Com/Images/W/Webp_402378-T1/Images/I/31Tzq2Dy-Hl._Sx300_Sy300_Ql70_Fmwebp_.Jpg,Https://Www.Amazon.In/Tp-Link-Bluetooth-Receiver-Ub500-Controllers/Dp/B098K3H92Z/Ref=Sr_1_117?Qid=1672903000&S=Computers&Sr=1-117

Everytime I Wear And Do The Resizing My Hair Gets Stuck In The Band Which Is Irritating. Rest Sound And All Is Goodüëçüèª,I Stopped Using It After Continuously Using For 3 Hrs For Office Use. It Can Not Be Used For Long Duration Calls Or Back To Back Meetings. Ears Starts Paining After 2-3 Hours Use. Speaker Cover Is Very Thin. I Will Give This Device To Someone Needy.Sound Quality And Built Quality Is Nice But Comfort Is Huge Issue With This Device Due It'S Tight Overhead Band. It Keeps Both Sides On Ear For Getting Better Sound Or Noice Cancellation. But The One Who Is Looking For Noice Cancellation Will Buy Over Ear Bigger Headphones.I Use All Types Of Headphones, Over-Ear, On-Ear, Earbuds. Earlier Used Sennheiser On-Ear Headphones But It Never Gives Pain.Ideally If Anyone Buying On-Ear Simple Headphones Then It Is For Calls Or Meetings Where They Still Want To Hear Sound In Their Room. Some Attention To Sound In Your Room, For Example Keeping An Eye On Kids While Being In Meeting. Basic Padding Or Multiple Layer Soft Covers For On-Ear Will Be Helpfull.Guys Go For Iball Rocker Over-Ear Or Hp Over-Ear Wired Headphones For Long Duration Office Calls. It Cost Less Compare To This Logitech Device.However This Is Still Good Buy For Upto 60 Mins Use For 1 Session/Call/Meeting And Then A Break. Only Issue For People Having Back To Back Meetings.,Nice Quality,I Bought This Because I Had To Work From Home And Had To Take Calls. My Only Worry Was The Noise Cancellation Because I Live Next To A Busy Road. And I Am Happy With The Purchase As The Noise Cancellation Is Working Great. People On The Other Side Of The Call Have Never Complained About Any Kind Of Background Noise. The Plastic Quality Used Is Great And It'S Not Squeaky. The Wire Is Long Enough. The Sound Output Is Good Enough, But I Don'T Intend To Listen Any Music On These. If You Need Something For Music Then This Is A Wrong Product.Con: The Cushion Is Not Adequate And Starts Hurting The Ear Lobes Within 5 Mins. I Had Some Extra Cushions So I Added Those Over The Ear Piece.,Build Quality Is Not That Good But Sound Quality,Noise Cancellation Is Best In The Range Of Less Than 1000.,After Covid-19 Our Life Changes A Lot. Online Meeting, Conferences, Webinar, Even Online Classes Became New Normals. In This Situation A Good Headphone With Mic Is Necessary For Doing Work Flawlessly And This Headphone Has Everything Which I Needed.1) Audio Quality Is Good And Crystal Clear Without Any Additional Noise2)Mic Is Also Very Good With Good Noise Cancellation3)Thanks To Amazon For Their Service And Ontime Delivery. Getting Early Delivery For The Product Was Bit Urgent For Me And It Was Delivered In Almost 6 Hour After Placing Order,I Am Fully Satisfied With The Product Highly Recommend For Students And Working Professionals Who Have Limited Budget,You Wont Regret It. :)4.

But For Outdoor Activities It Will Not Meet Our Expectations.,Awesome Product","Bahut Hi Achha Product Hai Badhiya Saund And Bluetooth Connectivity,Build Material Is Plastic Body. However, Sound Was Good,Nice,Sound Quality Is Goodbattery Performance Good,It Is A Satisfactory Bluetooth Speaker And Is Perfect Choice For Those Who Are Looking For A Budget Wireless Speaker For Their Laptop Or Mobile Phone With Low Volume Issues Or For Those Who Need Some Portable Music Device And Who Dont Want To Shell Out Lot Of Money. It Serves These Purpose Very Well And Is Not Pricey. Why I Am Saying All This‚Ä¶‚Ä¶First Things First, I Got This At 549 (The Black One Only As Rest Of The Colors Were Way Too Pricey And Choice Of Colors Can Be Sacrificed In Such A Case). 2. My Laptop And Phone Volume  Is Too Low And Watching A Video Or Listening To Music On These Devices Is Not A Good Experience. So Here Too This Speaker Served The Purpose As Connectivity Is Excellent, Size Of Speaker Is Conveniently Small, Lightweight And Battery Backup Is Damm Awesome. After A Complete Charge I Used This Speaker For Continuously For About 6 Hours At About 80% Volume And Still The Speaker Is Left With 60% Charge. I Cannot Comment Right Now For The Charging Time As It Arrived With More Than 70% Charge And I Just Topped It To Full. Bluetooth Connectivity Is Exceptionally Good Upto 10 Mtrs. Fm Reception Is Average Without Connecting The Data/Charging Cable But It Is Awesome If The Cable Is Connected. It Has Only Four Buttons And All The Functions Are Controlled By These Buttons Only. First Button ‚ÄúM‚Äù Is Mode Which When Pressed Switches From Bluetooth To Fm To Aux To Usb/Memory Card. Transition Of Switching Is Flawless. Volume Up/Down Keys Are Used To Change Volume And Switch The Channels. Long Press Changes The Volume And Short Press/Click Changes The Channels In Fm Or Changes The Track Via Aux. Most Usefull Feature Of This Speaker Is Its Mic. Yes, You Can Actually Use This Speaker (When Connected To Phone) To Talk With Someone And That Too With No Connectivity Issues. Voice Clarity Is Very Good For The Calls Made. Music Clarity Is Not Very Good. (Read Cons For This). Quality Of The Plastics Used Seems Good And Feels Durable.Cons. Sound Quality Is Just Average.  Voice Call Clarity Is Very Good Where Music Is Not Dominant. But When It Comes To Music, This Speaker Struggles To Deliver Quality. People Are Complaining In Reviews That It Doesnot Produce Any Bass, But Actually Its Is The Bass Produced By The Speaker Which Deteriorates The Quality. This Is Understandable For This Product As It Just Has One Tiny Speaker Inside And If Manufacturer Makes It To Produce Some Bass Will Definitely Deteriorate The Music Quality. But This Is Manageable And You Can Adjust The Music Equalizers In Your Laptop Or Phone To Get Pretty Decent Music Quality. This Is The Reason I Don‚ÄôT Consider Its Music Quality A Con For The Product. There‚ÄôS One Limitation About Charging Connector To. It Comes With A Charging Port Compatible To A/B Type Connector, So If You Have A Charger With Data Cable Supporting ‚ÄúC‚Äù Type Connectors, You Are Bound To Use The Charging Cable Supplied With Speaker Only. So You Cannot Keep Just One Common Cable With You To Charge Both Your Phone And Speaker. Instead You Will Have To Carry Two Different Cables. This Speaker Does Not Come With A Charger, So You Will Have To Use Your Mobiles Charger (5V, 1A)  For The Purpose. But For The Price Rage, This Seems Reasonable.Useful Tip For Buyers: Most Of The Smart Phones Will Display Battery Percentage Left In The Speaker. But You Can Install Any Of These Two Apps ‚ÄúBluebatt‚Äù Or ‚ÄúBluetooth Check Ringtone And Show Battery Level‚Äù From The Playstore, If In Case Your Phone Is Unable To Fetch Battery Data From Speaker.What You Get In Complete Package: 1 Unit Of Bluetooth Speaker, 1 Cable Which Has Aux Connector, Usb Connector And (A/B Type) Micro Usb Connector, 1 Tiny  User Manual.Quality Of Packaging: Excellent, Sturdy,  Packaging Used By Cloudtail To Secure The Company‚ÄôS Product Packaging.

We Will Discuss It In Detail In Upcoming Columns Of Speed.@ With A Micro-Usb Connector On One End And A Usb 3.0 Connector On The Other, The Drive Lets You Move Content Easily Between Your Android Phones, Tablets (With Micro Usb Ports Only) Or Laptops.Both The Connectors Are Carved Out Of Metal & The Usb 3.0 Connector Is Backward-Compatible With Usb 2.0 Ports.@ Size : The Size Of The Usb Is Quite Small Which Can Be Good For Easy Storage In Your Pockets But Might Be Tedious To Find If Misplaced.The Usb Fares Around An Inch In Perfect Closed Condition And 1.5‚ÄùInches When Expanded At Usb End.@ Construction: The Device Has A Plastic Body & The Overall Construction Of The Drive Is Just Average. The Retractable Plastic Column Seems To The Weakest Link Of All And Would Surely Break If You Accidentally Step Over It. However The Actual Drive Storage Portion Is Built Of A Rigid Plastic And Won‚ÄôT Give Up So Easily. Both The Usb Ports Are Built Of Metal Which Again Is Quite A Relief.@ Fit & Finish: Being Equipped With A Retractable Mechanism & Being Too Small, The Drive Is Not So Smooth To Use & Slide-In Or Out In A Single Shot And Needs Some Getting Used To But Then Most Of The Otg Drives Are Designed Small And Hence Have Some Or The Other Odd Way Of Conserving Size.The Usb Ports Fit Comfortably In Devices And Pulling It Out Too Is Fairly Easy.@ Storage Format: Since The Previous Fat32 Version Had A Limitation Of File Transfer Size Of A Maximum Of 4 Gb For A Single File & Ntfs Was Not Compatible With Mac Os So With Increasing File Sizes Ex Fat Format Was Devised Which Doesn‚ÄôT Have A Size Limitation Like Fat Yet Is Compatible With Mac As Well. So Our Drive Has Only Ex Fat & Ntfs Formats To Choose & Comes In Ex Fat By Default With 128 Kb File Allocation Size. Increasing The File Allocation Size May Increase The Transfer Speeds A Little But Will Affect The Storage Capacity Little Too. Changing It From 128 To 256 Kb Increased My Write Speeds From 13 Mb/S To 15 Mb/S If That‚ÄôS A Relief To Anyone.The Format Would Surely Work Well With Most Of The Tvs, Tablets And Mobiles Though Check It With The Car Audio Head Unit And Try To Change To Ntfs If It Doesn‚ÄôT Work.@ Speed (  The De-Merit Detail )  : I Have Been A Flagship Gadgets Freak All My Life & Preliminary To My Purchase I Had Doubts Regarding Its Speed As Quoted By Fellow Buyers But Then I Did Not Have Speed In My Mind As A Primary Motive For This & There Were Not Many Options For Dual Otg Device, So I Took A Leap Of Faith And Went Ahead With Purchase.My Basic Intent Was To Load Bulk Movies From My Laptop Into It And Watch It Over My Tv Or Mobile, However When I Was Transferring 6 Movies Of A Total Size 8.1 Gb , It Started Showing 15 Minutes Which Kept On Getting Higher & It Felt Like Waiting Forever For It To Happen.Even For A Single Movie Of 1.8 Gb It Took 2 Minutes 30 Sec By Stopwatch To Transfer. The Write Speeds Started With 13 Mb/Sec And Went Down & Down To 10-11 Mb/Sec. Even With My Older Kingston Dt Elite 3.0 16Gb,The Write Speeds Were In Excess Of 21 Mb/Sec.I Admit I Have A Usb 2.0 Port At My Laptop Yet I Was Never Used To Such Low Speeds Ever. The Tagline ‚ÄúUltra‚Äù And Mentioned Speeds Of 130 Mb/Sec (Which I Suppose Is The Rated Max. Speeds At Usb 3.0 Ports) Felt Like A Dream And Beyond Exaggeration.Finally With Every Passing Minute It Became All The More Unbearable And Annoying. Even In Ntfs Format Speeds Were The Same.I Had Never Expected It To Be This Slow In This Modern Era Of 2018, Thus Finally I Decided To Return It But I Suppose I Will Only Get A Replacement & Not Reversal.I Know That Read-Write Speeds Depend Upon A Lot Of Factors Including Transferred File Type, Format Configuration Of Drive, Configuration Of Host & Destination Device Etc.Benchmark Crystal Disk Mark Scores For A File Transfer Of 500 Mb Size Were 34 Mb/S -Read & 19 Mb/S ‚Äì Write Which Looked Like A Mere Consolation. Transfer Between My Samsung S7 Mobile & S2 Tablet Too Was Not Fast.Verdict : Yes My Friends , All Other Reviews About This Being Slow To The Point Of Being Unbearable Are Absolutely Right And Maybe San Disk Should Retag It As ‚ÄúUltra-Slow‚Äù.@ Storage : Out Of The Total Name Plate Rating Of 64 Gb , The Actual Allocated Space For Usage Is Around 57 Gb Which Is Ok Enough.@ Warranty : The Product Comes With A 5 Year Limited Warranty Which Is One Of The Segment Best Offers.@ Price : I Bought The Device For 1530 Bucks Which Was Reasonable To Me Given The Storage Size, Dual Drive & Brand Image. Mrp Over The Pack Was Printed 2190 Bucks & It Was Tagged Made In Malaysia. Only If, It Was A Bit Faster.Final Verdict:Xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxall In All, In My Personal Opinion Given The Brand Image, Ultra-Tagline & Modern Day Technology Advancements, Even If You Try To Be Too Generous Or Lenient Upon The Transfer Speeds Yet Its Hard To Spare Such A Low Read Write Rates.Even For Routine Tasks It Will Keep On Reminding You Of The Compromise You Made For A Full Price. It Could Have Been A Great All-Rounder Device Coupled With The Good Brand Reputation Of Sandisk & 5 Years Of Warranty, Had Its Speed Been Any Better.,Covered Here: Actual Storage Space, Heating, Mobile Phones, Tight Fitting On Mobile Phones, Speed, Formatting File System, Value For Money, Free App, Company, Brand, Seller.About Company, Product & Seller:1. Sandisk Ultra Is A Brand Of Western Digital Which Is The Same Company That Sells External Hard-Disk Storage Devices Under The Brand Wd Elements And Wd Portable.2. About 3 To 5 Years Ago, Wd Elements & Portable Drives Of 2Tb And 4Tb Were Priced Rs. 1200 Less Than Current Day Prices. They Were Sold By Cloudtail Seller On Amazon.3. Now Sandisk And Wd Drives Are Sold By Appario Retail Seller On Amazon.4. For Best Prices On Sandisk And Wd Products In India, The Current Seller Has The Lowest Prices For Authentic Brand New Products.5. Reason For Higher Prices For Same Brand'S Same Capacity Storage Devices May Be Various - Such As Import Duties, Taxes, Manufacturing Costs, Higher Demand For The Brand, Etc.Review: Sandisk Ultra Dual 64Gb Usb 3.0 Otg Pen Drive (Gold):1. Storage Space: Just As In External Hard-Disk Drives, The Actual Usable Storage Space Will Be Less Than What Is Mentioned On The Product.2. Same As Others: For The 64Gb Pen Drive, Actual Storage Space Available Is 57.2Gb. This Is Normal And Not Some Fraud Or Fake Advertisement. This Is Because It Has Fat32 File System. Also, The Device Uses Some Space For Its Functionality And Use.- In Linux Os Laptop The Available Storage Space On This Fat32 Pen Drive Is Shown To Be 61.5Gb. So That'S 4Gb More Than What Windows Os Calculates Using Their Ntfs File System.3. Heating: Even With Just 10 Minutes Of Use, You Can Touch And Feel That The Metal Part Of The Pen Drive Is Getting Heated. But The Performance Of The Drive Has Not Got Affected By The Heat. This Heating Does Not Happen In Wd External Hard-Disks And Seems To Be Unique To Small Pen Drives Of Various Brands.4. Mobile Phones: The Pen Drive Works With Android Os Of Mi Phones Such As Redmi Note Running Android Including Old Android Version 9 As Well.5. Too Tight For Phones: The Pen Drive Is A Tight Fit On Mobile Phones & Tablets - So Be Careful When Pulling It Out So As To Not Damage Your Phone - Because This Is Also The Charging Point For Your Phone. If You Feel That Your Phone Is Too Tight For This Pen Drive, Then It Is Best Not To Use It For Phone Data Storage Management.6. Value For Money: Even If You Don'T Use This Pen Drive For Mobile Phone - It Is Still The Best Price For A 64 Gb Pen Drive With A Usb 3.0 Backward Compatible With Older Usb Ports On Older Laptops And Computers.7. Speed: The Speed Is Extremely Good For Windows Os Laptop, Linux Os Laptop And Android Mobile Phones.8. File System Formatting The Pen Drive: Unless You Are Sure You Won'T Use Your Pen Drive On A Particular Device, Don'T Format The Pen Drive To Change Its Fat32 File System.But For Example, If You Have Decided That You Won'T Use It On Mobile Phones Or Tablets Because The Fitting Is Too Tight And You Don'T Want To Risk Damage To This Point Which Is Primarily Used For Charging - Then Go Ahead And Format The Pen Drive For Your Laptop.- With Ntfs Formatting You Will See An Increase In Available Storage Space In Your Pen Drive.- With Your Linux System'S File Format, You Will Have Better Storage Space Than Any Windows File System.- Beware That If The Pen Drive Has Ntfs File System Then It Won'T Work With Mobile Phones, Tablets, Laptops Which Don'T Have Windows Operating System. Same Way, If You Format The Pen Drive For Linux Os File System, It Won'T Be Recognised On Windows Laptops, Android Phones, Tablets, Etc.- If Like Most People You Will Be Using This Pen Drive On Laptops Or Other Devices Of Friends Or Co-Workers, Then Leave The Existing Fat32 File System As It Is.9. Free App: Memory Zone App For Android Is Bundled Free In This Pen Drive. It Is Easy To Install And Doesn'T Take Any Phone Permissions Other Than Storage Access. It Is Very Useful App With Easy User-Interface. App Takes 64Mb Storage Space On Android Phones.- Features Include: Cleaning Junk Files That You May Not Otherwise Know Through Your Phone'S File Manager App. Enable Or Disable Automatic Backup To Your Pen Drive. Add Cloud Storage Such As Google Drive Or Microsoft One Drive And Add Microsd Card Storage To Manage All Your Files From Just One Memory Zone App. Restore Backup. Copy, Move, Delete, Files As Well As Clean Up Whatsapp Related Files. See Available Storage Space On Your Phone. See Data Sorted Into Photos, Videos, Music, Documents.10. Beware - Users Of Memory Zone App Should Know That They Agree To Terms Of Use Which Include That If Some Government Agency Requests The Company For Information Against Piracy - Such As Illegal Copy, Storage, Distribution Of Movies, Music, Software, Books, Etc As Per Dmca Copyright Laws Then The Company Will Provide The User'S Data To The Government Investigating Agency To Protect The Intellectual Property Of Content Owners.Overall - Best Product In The Market, At Best Price In Indian Market, With Features Not Offered By Other Companies For Similar Specs.,Value For Money. May Be Desig Can Be Improve For The Sliding And Handling,It Was Good With Compatibility And Storage Of Data But Its Slow In Data Transfer.

The Only Drawback Is That Most Of The Features That It Offers Are Cloud Based And Requires You To Pay To Avail Them.Features Like ""Rich Notification"", Where The Phone Notifications Also Contain A Screenshot When The Motion Is Detected, Should Have Been Included As Part Of Free Service (At Least When Connected To The Same Wifi). As Of Now, The Only Free Notification That You Get Is An Alert With The Date And Time The Motion Was Detected And You Need To Open The App And Wait For It To Load Up Before Knowing What Motion Had Occured.Ai Motion Detection Also Should Have Been A Locally Available Free Feature Instead Of Relying On Cloud. The Normal Motion Detection Is Not Very Perfect And Has Few False Positives.Also, A Web Ui Would Have Been Nice To Have Instead Of Relying Only On The Tapo App To View And Configure The Settings.Overall, As A Normal Ip Camera With Recording, This Is Great But Most Features That It Provides Requires Paid Cloud Connectivity Which Was Disappointing And It Lacks A Web Ui.

But The Redeeming Feature Might Be The Looks. The Rgb Looks Cool (But You Cant Use Just One Single Color).

It Was Easy To Setup As A Extender . Signal Is Also Good But Not That Great. It Can Cover 1 Flat Well . Signal Breaks If Moving Upstairs Or Downstairs. Overall Great Purchase. Must Buy,Need Little Better Customer Support,Good,I Expected Much Stronger Signal 10 Meter Away. Its Okay Working, But Not As Expected.,Tp Link Is Good Product,Good Product,Decided On Buying This Router From Tp-Link After Days Of Research, Reading Reviews And Talking To Many People Regarding Different Models.Was On A 20 Mbps Connection With A Netgear N300 Router Since 2016 Which Used To Suffice For Moderate Usage Till Now. However, With Increase In The Number Of Devices Like Smart Tv, 2 Ipads And A Laptop Etc, It Necessitated An Upgrade. Also, Considering The Current Work-From-Home Scenario Which Is Bound To Continue For The Foreseeable Future As Well, The Internet Usage Was Being Stretched To It'S Limit And The Trusted Netgear Router Simply Couldn'T Match Up To The Increased Bandwidth Demand.To Capitalise On The Current Situation, Our Current Isp Came Out With Interesting Fibre Broadband Plans And We Opted For A 75 Mbps Connection. That In Turn Needed A New Router To Utilize It'S Optimum Potential. Finally Zeroed In On The Tp-Link Archer C80 After Reading Some Horror Stories Of Other Available Routers. Was Also Tempted To Buy The Ax1500 Considering There'S Barely Any Price Difference, But Then Came Across A Few Reviews Which Stated That Wifi 6 Is Not Entirely Successfully Implemented And Might Prove To Be An Hindrance To Use With Our Current Range Of Devices.Order Delivered By Amazon Within A Day. Full Marks For The Seamless Delivery As Always. Prime Has Truly Been A Boon.Installed The Router Today. Installation Via Tether App Was Seamless. Isp Guy Helped With The Pppoe Sign-In Process And Released The Mac Id Which Was Bound To Our Old Router. The Whole Process Was Done In 10 Mins And We Were Online.The Dual Bands Are Truly A Boon. Have Divided The Devices At Home Equally Between 2.4G And 5G As Per Usage. As The Router Is Close To The Tv Unit, Have Connected It To 5G And Also Alternatively Connected Via The Ethernet Cable (Just In Case).Speed Tests:Started Off By Streaming 4K Content Simultaneously On 2 Devices Connected To 5G. Played Seamlessly Even With Other Devices Like Mobiles Etc Being Connected.Have Attached A Few Pictures For Reference.- Sitting Near The Router, 5G Download Speed Is 77 Mbps And Upload Is 75.4 Mbps.- 5G Speed Tested In The Bedroom With A Wall In Between: Download 72.4 Mbps And Upload 74.9 Mbps.- 2.4G Speed In The Same Room As The Router Is: Download 68.3 Mbps And Upload 79.2 Mbps. (This Is Quite Surprising As A Few Reviews Mentioned 50-55 Mbps Will Be The Threshold For 2.4G. Used To Get A Maximum Of 45 Mbps Download On My Old N300).- Speed Test Via The Ethernet Cable Provided In Thr Box Connected To The Tv: Download 78 Mbps And Upload 75 Mbps.Couldn'T Have Asked For More Really. This Seems To Be Totally Ideal.Build Quality Of The Device Is Decent And The Antennas Seem Well Enough To Do The Job, However Would Have Preferred That They Were Placed Like Other Tp-Link Models Like The Archer A6, So It Would Have Been Easier To Move Them In Preferred Directions.The Led Lights Are A Little Weirdly Placed And Not Bright Enough. Maybe I'M Used To The Prominent Lights On My Old Router. These Are A Blink-And-Miss Sort And You Have To Bend A Little To Check In Case There'S An Issue. One Big Element Missing In This Device Is A Usb Port Which Is Absolutely Essential In Today'S Age And Expected To Be Included For This Price Range. Wonder What'S The Reason Behind Giving It A Miss.I Have Sealed The Extra Lan Ports With Tape To Protect From Dust Or Moisture. It'S A Good Practice. The Outer Design Of The Router Is Quite Sophisticated And Stylish, However I'M A Little Worried Of Dust Accumulating In The Intricate Design On The Top Portion.Functionally Though, This Seems To Be A Real Good Offering From Tp-Link. Hope This Device Lives Up To Expectations In Coming Days. All-In-All, Seems To Be A Worthy Investment For The Next Few Years, Considering An Internet Plan Upgrade, If Any.Hope I Touched Upon Major Points Which Might Help Other Interested Consumers In Making A Choice. This Product Is Recommended! :)",Https://M.Media-Amazon.Com/Images/W/Webp_402378-T1/Images/I/41C7Bjo7Ool._Sx300_Sy300_Ql70_Fmwebp_.Jpg,Https://Www.Amazon.In/Tp-Link-Archer-C20-Wireless-Router/Dp/B0759Qmf85/Ref=Sr_1_187?Qid=1672903004&S=Computers&Sr=1-187

With An Overall Positive Impression Of Logitech'S Performance (Compared To My Experience With Similar From Dell, Hp) - I Decided To Try The Slightly Cheaper And Compact Mk215.While I Knew This Would Be More Compact, With Fewer Keys - I Feel I Should Highlight The Disadvantages I Can See Immediately (Especially For Users Of Full-Size Keyboards At Work - Refer Image)1. While My Hands Will Get Used To Closer Keys - They Also Seem Much Less ""Springy"" (Lower). Overall Size Is Also Too Small To Place On One'S Lap And Type, Which I Could With The Other Wireless Keyboard, Especially During Wfh.2. Big Point Is The Much Larger Size Of The Dongle. This Will Need To Be Removed And Stashed Carefully At Home Every Time I Throw My Laptop Into My Bag For A Meeting. I Never Did This For Mk270 And Simply Kept Dongle Fixed Forever To My Laptop Usb Port. That Dongle Also Had A Slot Inside The Mouse For Safekeeping, Which Is Not There In Mk215.3. Neither Mouse Nor Keyboard Has A Switch Off - Mk270 Had Switch On Both. Mk215 Mouse Takes 2 Aa, Whereas Mk270 Takes 1 Battery.4. Mouse Is Shaped Different - Lower Arch And Wider - Which May Simply Take Adjusting. Feels A Little Cheaper.While A Real Review Can Only Be Provided Much Later - Seeing How Keys/Clicks Perform Over The Long Run (And One Hopes That Logitech Will Have Taken Care Of That Quality) - While I Don'T Have Any Complaints So Far, I Feel Paying A Bit Extra For The Mk270 May Suit Many Folks Out There.

The Information Provided Below Is As Per The Manufacturer.ÔÇß Boat Bassheads 225 Have A Frequency Range Of 20 Hz To 20 Khz.ÔÇß It Features 10 Mm Drivers.ÔÇß Rated Impedance Of 16 Ohms.ÔÇß Comes With 1.2 Meter Flat Tangle Free Cable.ÔÇß 3.5 Mm Gold-Plated L-Shaped Audio Jack (90 Degrees).ÔÇß Sensitivity : 98 Db+/-3 Db.____________________Built Quality & Design---------------------------------I Was Not Expecting Metal Built At This Price Range But To My Surprise, Boat Bassheads 225 Are Fully Made Up Of Metal. It Has A Diagonal Grid-Like Texture On The Buds Which Feels Amazing On Touch. The Metal Construction Gives Boat Bassheads 225 A Premium Feel & Attractive Appearance. The Cable Used By Boat On Bassheads 225 Is Flat With Rubberized Coating, It Is A Tangle-Free Cable & Does It'S Job Well By Decreasing The Chances Of The Cable Tangling. Despite The Metal Construction, Boat Bassheads 225 Are Very Lightweight & Comes With A Microphone & L-Shaped 3.5 Mm Audio Jack Which Is Again Made Up Of Metal. Overall The Built Quality Is Excellent For The Price & Seems Very Durable. The Ear Buds Have Proper L & R Labels And Are Clearly Visible. Boat Bassheads 225 Comes With Medium Sized Silicone Tips Already Installed Out-Of-The-Box.___________Audio Quality-------------------To Ensure That I Can Test The Bassheads 225 At Their Uppermost Limit, I Used High-Quality Mp3 Files Of 320 Kbps & Lossless Audio Formats Like Flac & Wav. For Smartphone Listening, I Used Poweramp Music Player & Tweaked Settings Every Now And Then To See Their Extreme Capability. For The Computer, I Used Itunes Player & Vlc Audio Player. I Also Tested These Earphones On Apple Ipod, Iphone & Sony Mp3 Player. All This Went For More Than 10 Days & Finally, I Had My Results.Boat Bassheads 225 Promised What They Claimed, They Really Are Very Bassy As Compared To Others. During My Tests With Them, I Found That The Audio Quality Is Very Good For The Price, The Bass Output Is Amazing And Overpowers The Vocals By Default, By Tweaking The Equalizer Settings A Bit, I Saw A Good Level Of Improvement In The Vocals, They Were Clearer Than Before But Overall Average. The Treble Was Again Very Good, The High-Frequency Sounds Were Clear & Pleasant To Ears. The Mids Were Average But Overall The Audio Experience On Boat Bassheads 225 Was Decent. When Listening To Music, The Overall Sound Quality Is Amazing, You Can Easily Distinguish Between Different Instruments & Sounds Which Is A Good Thing For Extra Bassy Headphones.______________________Noise Isolation & Comfort-------------------------------------When It Comes To Noise Isolation, Boat Bassheads 225 Are Very Good At It, They Come With Medium Sized Ear Tip Pre-Installed Which Seemed Perfect For My Ears, Once The Earphones Are On, I Wasn'T Able To Hear Outside Noise, They Sealed My Ears Completely & Delivered An Immersive Experience. Make Sure That You Have The Right Pair Of Ear Tips On For Better Noise Isolation & Comfort. Overall Boat Bassheads 225 Are Comfortable But They Seem A Bit Stiff & Somewhat Awkward When Used For Longer Periods. Since The Housing Is Made Up Of Metal, You May Find Them Popping Out Every Now & Then When Used During Running, Jogging Or Any Other Sport Or Physical Activity, This Didn'T Happen As Often For Me But For A Friend, They Keep Popping Out Every Now & Then While Running (Maybe The Shape Of Ears Has Something To Do With It), An Easy Solution To This Will Be Using The Ear Hooks Which Came Along With It. When Using Bassheads 225 With Ear Hooks, They Were A Bit Uncomfortable Initially, But As I Got Used To Them, They Were Fine, Plus This Stopped Popping Issue Since The Hooks Keep A Hold On Them.-----------------------------------------Flat Cable & Microphone-----------------------------------------The Cable Is Great, I Personally Prefer Flat Cables And This Earphone Come With A Perfect Flat Cable Which Is Tangle Free & Comes With A Rubberized Coating. The Cable Does Its Job Well. The Microphone Is Again Exceptionally Good, It Records Voice With Clarity With Less To No Disturbance Or Background Noise. During Calls, The Person On The Other End Can Clearly Hear The Voice With No Background Disturbance. There Is One Button On The Microphone Which Helps To Pick Up/Reject Calls On The Go, Without Taking Your Phone Out. It Can Also Be Used To Control Music, Which Is Again A Good To See In A Budget Friendly Earphone Like Boat Bassheads 225.____________________Warranty & Price---------------------------------Boat Bassheads 225 Comes With Standard One Year Warranty, So Make Sure You Keep The Purchase Invoice Safe, In Case You Need It For Warranty._____________Final Thoughts!----------------------I'Ve Personally Used Boat Bassheads 225 In-Ear Headphones For More Than Two Weeks (Average Daily Two Hours Of Listening) Before Writing This Review And I'M Pretty Much Impressed With Them. I'M Personally A Fan Of Extra Bass Iem'S And Currently, My Primary Iem Is Sony Mdr-Xb50Ap Which Again Falls Under Extra Bass Category. Comparing Sony Mdr-Xb50Ap With Boat Bassheads 225 Will Be Unfair Since There Is A Big Price Difference Between Both Of Them, But I Would Still Like To Add That Bassheads 225 Did A Great Job And Didn'T Disappoint Me, Obviously It Doesn'T Stand A Chance In Front Of Sony Mdr-Xb50Ap But Still Looking At The Price Of Bassheads 225 & The Quality They Offer, I Was Really Very Impressed.Boat Bassheads 225 Turned Out To Be Exceptional Earphones, After Testing Them For More Than Two Weeks With Different Devices & Music Players, I Can Say That They'Re Amazing For The Price, A Pure Steal Deal. The Bass Output Is Amazing And Is Very Intense, I'Ll Recommend Using Correct Size Ear Tips & Good Quality Music Player Like Poweramp (Android) For Better Bass Output. The Treble Is Good & Vocals Are Average, Somewhere I Feel That Bass Overpowers The Vocals, But By Tweaking The Equalizer A Bit You Can Achieve Better Results. The Mids Are Again Average.*****************************My Rating : 4 Out Of 5*****************************____________________The Verdict---------------------------------Taking Everything Into Account, Overall I'M Very Impressed With Boat Bassheads 225. The Built Quality Is Amazing, The Performance Is Exceptionally Good With Powerful Bass & Good Overall Soundstage. Tweaking The Equalizer A Bit Can Bring Drastic Improvements To Other Areas Like Vocals, Mids & Highs. Overall The Vocal & Highs Are Good & Mids Are Average But Still Good For The Price. I'Ll Recommend These Iem'S To Bass Lovers & Budget-Conscious People Who Are Looking For High Quality & Durable Earphones At A Reasonable Price. Genres Like Edm, Rock, Hip-Hop Sound Really Great On Them. Boat Bassheads 225 Justify The Price They Come For, The Results Are Very Good As Compared To Other Earphones In Same Price Range.Hope I Helped You.Thanks,Yes, So You Have Heard That This Is The Best Wired Earphone Under 500. Yes You Can Consider It To Buy. But There Are Few Points To Remember Before Buy. From My User Experience I Can Tell You This-1. This Is Not Comfortable At All. It Slips From Ear Mostly. You Feel Pain In Ear After Using It.2. Never Buy This For Online Class, As It Is Not Possible To Wear It 6-8 Hours Straightly.3. After Switching From Boat Basshead 172, I Feel That The Bass Is Not Good As The Previous One. I Don'T Know Why. It Should Be Better.4. Sound Don'T Explode Or Go Outside Of The Buds To 50% As It Go Outside On Boat 510 Headphone, So Its Good.5. Feeling Heavier On Ears. Not As Comfortable As Realme Buds 2. Though Both Are Metal Build. For Balance Sound You Can Buy Realme Buds 2.6. Buy It Only To Listen Music, Not For Too Long Time. Do Not Consider It For Online Class And Long Time Wear Session.  Hope It Helped You. Its Just My Opinion From Using Boat 225, Boat 172, Boat 510, Realme Buds 2, Mi Basic.,It'S A Very Good Product But I Don'T Recommend Buying This Because Earpiece Is Heavy And You Need To Keep Adjusting It And Pushing It Inside Whenever You Move Your Head, They Will Fall Off Easily With The Slightest Motion, You Will Soon Find It Annoying.

This Is Not Sufficient, If We Want More Details. However The Unit Is Robust, Easy To Disassemble, Easy To Replace Battery With Generic Battery, Having Best Transfer Time (Less Than 4 Milli Sec) 37Min Backup For Cpu + Monitor When Checked. In View Of This,  The Legrand Numeric Ups Digital 600Ex-V Should My The Number One Choice. But It Also Has Low  User Ratings.The  Following Brands  Came To My Notice On Search.1) Apc Bx600C-In2) Apc Bx600Ci-In3) Emerson Liebert Iton Cx 600(I Have Not Considered Microtek, Intex, Iball; Vguard Etc May Be They Are Good)The Technical Parameters Of The Above All Looked Similar , Like Generator Compatibility, Avr, High/Low/Overload Protections. But The Transfer Time Specified For Numeric Is Less Than 4 Milli Sec, For  Apc 10 Milli Sec Typical, And For Liebert 4-8 Milliseconds.Apc Bx600C-In  Is Selected As My Requirement Is Not For Pc Or Laptop (Further Search Is Not Done For Ups With Communication Port And Auto Save Software ) And  In View Of Better Interface  ( Power Led Dual Color, Charging Led Dual Colour, Battery Saver Led ) . It Also Has  Better Backup And Surge Power Than Apc Bx600Ci-In (Minus Resettable Thermal Relay)Based On The Reviews, There Are Four Major Issues I Have Noticed,(1) Very Old Stock (Battery Capacity Expected To Be In Reduced Condition, Resulting Into Low Backup Time) Or Battery Issue.(2) Transit Damages, As It Is Bulky To Its Volume. Though It Is Better To Purchase Such Items Offline, I Still Tried Online In View Of Remote Location.(3) No Load Protection .  It Acts  If Very Low Load Is Connected (E.G. Just Modem  Or Less Than 30W And Battery Saver Mode Is On  ) After 5 Min , People Get Confused It As Giving Only 5 Min Backup (It Shouldn'T Be Considered As A Problem Once Known, Since Additional Loads Can Be Connected Or Battery Saver Mode Can Be Unselected)(4) If Battery Saver Is Enabled , It Shutdowns While 5 Min Juice Still Left (It Shouldn'T Be Considered As  A Problem,  Since It Can Be Unselected If Selected Intentionally Or Unintentionally)To Reduce The Above Risks, M/S Appario Retail Private Ltd Was Chosen (At Lightening Deal At Rs Rs2659.00). The Order Was Placed On 10.04.19. The Product Is Delivered In 4 Days On 13.04.19. The Original Packing Was Wrapped In Repeated Turns Of Polyethylene. The Packing Reached Without Any Major Distortions. The Original Cartoon Packing Was In Sealed Condition. However When It Was Opened, Some (Parts) Looseness Sound Was Coming From The Ups. The Same Was Reported To Apc Service Center. They Registered The Complaint And Told Me That The Service Person Will Visit Within 48 Hours Of Working Days. Further They Have Given Clearance To Put The Ups In Service.First It Was Charged Fully , While Ups In Off Condition (Charging Light Was On While Charging And It Became Off After Charging). Now The Ups Was Made On By Power Button (It Is To Be Pressed And Hold For Not Less Than 1 Second Before Release Or Release After Beep Tone) Connected To Pc With 32 Inch Led Tv, Initially Some Repeated Chattering (Without Any Power Interruption To The Load) Was Happening, If Power Input Is Kept Off (On Battery). It Was Happening Some Times.When It Is On Battery,  Beep Sound Was Occurring Every 22 Sec Against Apc Manual Spec Of 60 Sec.It Withstood For 18 Minutes For The Pc With 32 Inch Led Tv On Battery. (Battery Save Mode Was In Off Condition)Further It Got Switched Off Within 5 Sec Of Low Battery Alarm, Against 60 Sec Specified In The Manual.The Manufacturing Date As Per Slip Glued On Original Packing Was Nov, 2018 (Photo Attached) But The Test And Quality Passing Date Is 11.01.2018 12.53 Hrs (Photo Attached)(As My Load Is More Than 30W,  I Can Put It On Battery Saver Mode, The Battery Saver Button To Be Pressed And Hold For Not Lessthan 2 Seconds Before Release To Change The State , This  Is Minor But The Holding Time Is No Where Written In The Manual).The Ups Body Temperature Appears To Be On Higher Side, When Compared To Numeric Installed At Office Under Similar Ambient Temperature (While On Load With Input Mains As Well As While In Off Condition Without Charging But Connected To Mains).The Above Is Initial Experience Only, Any Updates Shall Be Shared In Future.Note1: This Item Isn'T Eligible For Returnfor Safety Reasons, Items Containing Flammable Liquids Or Gases Can'T Be Returned To Amazon. For More Information Or Help, Please Contact Them.(If You Want Return Facility Search For Other Alternatives)Update 1The Service Person Called Me On 14.04.19 And Informed About His Planned Visit On 15.04.19.The Service Person Visited In The Morning Of 15.04.2019 And Disassembled The Ups, There Was A  Minor Play With The Battery, ( The Whole Casing Is Of Plastic, One Side Cover Opens Including Top As One Part) The Play May Be Due To Design / Manufacturing Tolerances. The Pcb And The Transformer Were Already Firmly Fastened To Body And All Connections Were Also Tight. Hence The Looseness Is Acceptable. The Battery Manufacturing Date Was Oct 2018. I Agreed For His Optional Proposal To Replace With A New Sealed Battery (But Manufactured In Sept 2018). The Chattering May Be Relevant To Building Wiring, As It Is Not Happening With Main Sockets In Other Rooms Or If We Remove Ups Input Plug From The Same Socket (See Next Update For Accurate Reason) .  In The Whole,  The Service Person‚ÄôS Only Concern Was Hotter Transformer, Based On His Experience (But It Will Be Replaced Only If It Fails).Prompt Response Of Service Center Is Appreciable (That Too For An Interior Of 76 Km From Service Center, Located At State Capital) And It Compliments The Non Return Policy.Update 2It Is Fully Charged With Replaced Battery  And Backup Time Was Tested With The Same Load As Above. But This Time Large Improvements Were Observed In The Backup Time And  Parameters (Difficult To Reason Out) As Below.Backup Time Is 32 Min (Until Some Different  Type Of Blinking Of Power Led  & Different Type Of Beeps Happens For Few Seconds, May Be Relevant To Battery Saver Mode  And However It Got Normalized In Auto ) After 5 Min Further,  The Battery Low Blinking Of Power Led Occurred (Hence Total 37 Min Against 18 Min Of Earlier Experience As Above) And These Beeps Occurred For 40 Seconds Before It Tripped (Against 5 Seconds Of Earlier Experience As Above), But Power Led Was Glowing For Every Few Seconds Till Further 20 Seconds In Off Condition.Battery On  Beep Was Occurring For Every 59.90 Seconds (~1 Min) To Indicate The Load Is On Battery (Against Every 22 Second Earlier Experience As Above). I Was Totally Involved With Service Person As It Has To Protect Very Costly, Bulky And  Distant Service Partner Type Equipment At My Home . He Has Replaced Only Battery, And He Has Not Even Removed The Pcb. But How,  So Many Wonders Have Happened Is Yet To Be Analyzed And Reasoned Out.Note 2:I) Nonrms-Multimeter Does Not Properly Read The Voltage Of A Ups That Uses Stepped Approximated Output Sine Wave While On Battery. Hence  Output Voltage Of A 230 Vac Ups Is Measured To Be Between 170-180 Vac When On Battery.Ii) Low Voltage Cut Off Will Act If Any Separate Low Voltage , High Voltage Cutoff Protection Is Used At Outlet Of Ups (While On Battery)Iii) Chattering May Take Place At Ups If Any Separate Surge Protection Is Used At Ups Outletiv) Some Body Already Advised Not To Use Any Surge Protection At Input To Upsv) Apc Service Person Informed That Apc Ups Will Not On, If House Is Not Properly Grounded (Earthing Is To Be Proper) To Protect From Surges.Vi) If Ups Is On Battery With Battery Saver Mode Enabled  (I.E. Mains Off) It Will Give Only 5 Min Backup To Loads Less Than  30W (As No Load Protection Acts),  However If The Load Is More Than 30W , It Shutdowns While 5 Min Juice Still Left ( I.E. If We Disable Battery Saver Mode  We Will Get 5 Min More Backup Power)From The Above , The Ups Is Now Functioning As Per Specifications. (But One Star Of Apc Is Reduced Against Initial Issues Of Equipment, Though Super Fast Response Exists From Their Service Center) , 5 Stars To  ""M/S Appario Retail Private Ltd"" The Seller, 5 Stars To The Apc Service Center And 5 Stars To Courier "" M/S Delivery"" For Safe And Fast Delivery.Update 3: After 4 Months Of Use , Backup Time Testing (Ignoring Erroneous Tests In Between):The Ups Was Made On And Battery Saver Was Made Off , Due To This  The Ups Started Self Charging Further And I Have Waited Till The Charging Is Completed. Now,  The Tv As Monitor With Pc Were Made On ( It Took Upto 0.45 Amp During Cold Boot , Amp Measured With Clamp Meter) While Mains Is On. Once The Pc Stabilised (0.3A) The Mains Is Switched Off. Now It Gavea  Backup Of 17 Minutes With Beep Every Minute And Given Repeated Beeps At 17Th Min. Again Every Min One Beep Started For 5 Min. After This Repeated Beeps Occurred  For 30 Second And Ups Got Tripped. Hence I Got 22 Minutes And 30 Seconds In Total. In View Of This The Star Rating Is Retained At 4 Star.One More Observation Is That It'S Transformer Temperature Is High While It Is On Battery That Means (More) Energy Is Being Wasted By Transformer.I Got The Battery Replaced One More Time On 15,01.2020 Under Warranty As Backup Time Reduced To 11Min Under The Same Conditions And Load. With New Battery I Am Getting 24 Minutes. Hence The Apc Is Being Letdown By Battery Manufacturer Where Apc Quality Person Should Have Control. After Warranty I Will Install Battery From Exide And See.,Pros:The Device Is Sleek, Small And Blends Into The Environment.Cons:Makes A Lot Of Noise.I Bought This Primarily To Support My Television Sony Xr-65X90K To Handle The Switch From Generators To Mains (For < 30 Secs). It Is Not Sufficient To Do That And The Tv Switches On And Off Continuously When Running On Ups Power. I'M Not Sure What The Problem Is As The Wattage Is Sufficient.If You Have A Similar Use Case As Mine, Better Consult A Local Inverter Shop And Get A Ups That Fits Your Requirement. Else, You Will End Up With Dead Weight.,Easy To Install,My Pc Has A 550W Psu With 80+ Bronze Effeciency But Installed Components Are Not Supposed To Go Beyond 280Watts Under Max Load. This Ups Shuts Down As Soon As My Gpu (Gtx 970) Reaches 100%.Then I Used It For My Printer. But As Soon As I Hit Print, The Ups Shuts Down. So It'S Useless There As Well.Now It'S Attached To My Tv, Router And Speakers. Atleast I Can Watch Netflix Uninterrupted.,I'M Getting Trouble In This I Think This Is Not Working Properly Where Should I Return,Value For Money, So Far Working Good.,Small But Big Life Of Battery,It Is Good For Electricity Stability",Https://M.Media-Amazon.Com/Images/W/Webp_402378-T1/Images/I/31Ssnzuskfl._Sx300_Sy300_Ql70_Fmwebp_.Jpg,Https://Www.Amazon.In/Apc-Bx600C-600Va-230V-Back/Dp/B016Xvrkzm/Ref=Sr_1_211?Qid=1672903005&S=Computers&Sr=1-211

They Serve The Purpose Of A Decent Pair Of Tws For Basic Quality Calls And Music Listening. Main Problem I Noticed Was With The Pairing And Connection Strength As They Routinely Lose Signal For No Apparent Reason. Once Or Twice I Had Issue Of Only One Of The Buds Getting Paired And Had To Reset The Other One To Get It Paired.If You Have Paired These To One Device And Try To Pair To Another One Without Disconnecting From First It Simply Doesn'T Work. This Is Starting To Get Annoying But Maybe I'Ll Get Used To It. We'Ll See.----------------------------------------------------------This Is Just Day 1 Review Of These. Got Them For Rs 898 On Some Offer On Amazon. I'Ll Post Updates Later On. Hope This Is Helpful For Anyone Interested.Package : The Packaging Is Quite Decent For Such A Low Price. Comes With The Tws Earphones Fitted With Medium Earplugs Fitted Inside The Case. Also Included Are A Very Short Usb C Cable And Two Additional Earplugs - Small And Large. Package Includes Some Noise Stickers And A Pretty Good User Manual And Warranty Instruction Card.Build : Was Immediately Dissapointed With The Plastic Case As The Lid Was Rattling And Not Confidence Boosting. Will Use It For A While To See If My Worries Are Unfounded. The Earphones Themselves Are Rather Sturdy Feeling In Hand. They Fit Very Snuggly Into The Case And There Is No Evident Feel Of Them Coming Lose Or Rattling Within The Case.Comfort : This Is Very Subjective And Each Ear Is Different. It'S One Of The Reaonss I Wanted To Get A Cheap Tws To See If I'M Ok With The Form Factor For Long Hours. The Prefitted Medium Size Earplugs Were Not Comfortable So I Switched To The Small Size Ones. And After About 20 Mins I Forgot I Was Even Wearing Them. The Earbuds Are Very Lightweight Owing To The Plastic Build But Upside Is That They Don'T Cause Any Strain Even After An Hour Of Continuous Use. One Thing To Note Is That If You Have ""Gandhi"" Ears Then The Fit Might Be A Little Awkward - I Should Know. My Ears Covered The Touch Areas Of The Buds So I Had To Fiddle Around A Bit If I Wanted To Do Any Of The Touch Actions. Ymmv.Sound Quality : I Liked Them. I'M No Audiophile But They Have Decent Volume And Satisfactory Levels Of Bass And Separation. I Tried My Usual Test At Https://Youtu.Be/J0A2Prc_Mqo And They Fared Quite Well. The Treble Maxes Out At 15Khz Post Which You Hear Nothing At All But This Is To Be Expected At The Price Point. There Was Noticeable Vibrations Creeping In At Below 30Hz But The L And R Drivers Seem To Be Matched Well And All Of The Panning Tests Were Quite Decent. I Feel This Definitely Punches Above Its Price Point.Call Quality : In A Low To No Outside Noise Environment The Microphones Were Very Good. There Was No Lag And The Person On The Other Side Said My Voice Was Very Clear. But Things Take A Steep Fall As Soon As Little Noise Is Present And You Start Sounding Like You'Re Inside A Well. Seems The Mics Can'T Figure Out How To Filter Out Your Voice So They End Up Trashing The Call Quality. Overall You Get What You Pay For Here.Range : Max I Got Was Around 5M. Not Sure How They Tested And Got 10M As Advertised. Any Disruptions Like A Wall Will Simply Break The Connection But They Connected Back Automatically Every Time So Far So I Guess That'S Passable.Pairing :------ Update On 12Th Aug 2022  - - - - - -Major Issue Here Is That If Already Paired To A Device Like A Laptop They Simply Are Unable To Be Paired To Another Device Like Your Phone. You Have To Unpair From The First Device And Then Try To Pair Again. Had Issues Like Only One Of The Buds Pairing As Well.Have To Fiddle Around To Get It To Work And Is Not Convenient.---------------I Don'T Have A Phone To Test The Fast Pair Features - Actually I'M Not Even Sure These Support It. Anyway, The Earphones Go Into Pairing Mode As Soon As You Remove Them From The Case And I Was Able To Pair With No Problems On Multiple Phones. They Will Auto Pair Post This Initial Setup To Previously Paired Devices. I Could Not Find Any Way To Control The Pairing Mode Though. You Have To Live With What It Comes With As There Is No App Or Anything To Control What It Does. They Switch Off Pairing Mode Once You Put Them In The Case So Hopefully That Means The Battery Would Be Saved A Little.Battery Life : Way Too Early To Tell Anything. Will Share My Experience Post One Week And One Month. But They Came Around 80% Charged In The Box And I Have Stated To Charge The Case - Box Says It Will Take 2Hrs To Fully Charge It And There Are Basic Indicators Like A Flashing Red Led For Charging Which Turns Solid Red Once Done. The Earphones Also Have Leds That Blink Red & White To Indicate Pairing, Low Battery Etc.Sync Issues : None So Far. But Have Seen Many Such Reports And Reviews Wherein The L And R Earphones Seem To Go Out Of Sync On Similar Low Price Twses. So Will See If I Face Any Such Problems.These Are The Primary Areas That I Am Concerned With While Evaluating Any Tws So Will Share How My Experience Is After A While. So Far I'M Happy With Them.,Hi, My Name Is Akshay.I Used This Product And This Is Very Good In Sound And Valuable Money.Good In Calling Also.Everything Is Perfect.,Good Sound Quality...,Buds Are Very Good Quality.

With Mechanical Usb Keyboards There Is A Latency But Chiclet And Usb Dongle Based Wireless Keyboards Seem To Work Well.- Usb Or Wireless Usb (Rf) Mouse Works Perfectly. Very Little Noticeable Latency- Not For Gaming Purposes (Keyboards/Mice/Joysticks Etc.). This Is A No Brainer. In Rapid Response Gaming Environments Were Latency Is Life Or Death. An Extension Is Not An Option.Cons: (Check Image)The Usb Female Slots In The Extension Are Shallow. The Male Plugs Do Not Go In Fully. There Is 0.5 Cm Of The Metal Plug Exposed. This May Be A Risk In Exposed/Outdoor Environments. Humidity Increases The Chances Of Electric Shock, And Dust Being An Insulator May Cause Static Electricity Build Up. The Worst Case Is If A Conductor Falls Across The Exposed Points, The Whole System Can Short Out.Suggest The Designers Take This Into Consideration For Their Next Batch Of Products. The Depth Of The Usb Slots Needs To Accommodate The Full Length Of The Usb Plugs.Functionally It Works, Design Leaves A Lot Wanting. Go For It If Are Sure You Can Be Safe, Go For A Different Model If You Need This For Outdoor Use.Update: 15Th Nov 2022On Connecting The Keyboard To The Usb Drive, There Seems To Be An Increased Latency And Sometimes The Keyboard Does Not Respond As Anticipated. The Text Does Not Appear On The Screen Immediately And Sometimes A Particular Letter Just Cascades Repeatedly, And One Has To Press Backspace Often To Delete The Excess Letters.

I Use It For Mobile Vlogging.,Noice Cancellation Is Not Working,Value Of Money üí∞,Good Mike, Worth Money,Very Nice Mic In This Price Range.,After Seeing Many Microphone. I Found Thisi Bought It Becuase Of Its Good Ratings And Reviews And In A Buget Price. This Is Best For Beginners,The First Time I Had Ordered This Mic, I Received In A Amazon Plastic Bag And The Product Box Inside Was Completely Damaged And Was Sealed Using Cello Tape. Also, The Mic Seller Sent Me Was Damaged And Had Low Quality Audio. It Was A Duplicate.But, When I Replaced, I Received The Packing In A Cardboard Box But Still The Inner Box Had A Few Damages.The Mix Received Inside Was Good.Here Is A Detailed Review Of The Mic:1. The Quality: Quality Overall Nice. The Wire Might Seem Filthy And Weak But In Reality When I Tested It, It Was Indeed A Bit Durable. It Can Easily Sustain A Bit Of A Pull And Twist. Just Mind The Spots When The Wire Meets The Audio Jack And The Mic2. Sound Quality: Sound Quality Is Really Nice. But But But... Before You Think Of Buying It, Read The Paragraph Below (Of Noise Cancellation). The Mic Catches Sound Equally Even If You Are From Far Away Or Close To It.3. Noise Cancellation: This Is A Major Point. I Used To Mic A Lot For Testing Purposes. Let Me Share My Experience. I Tested It In Different Environments.A. In A Closed Room With Ac And Total Silence: In Such Environment, You Will Get Crisp Sound Like A Boom Microphone. But, You Will Also Receive A Bit Of White Noise Or Background Static Noise Which You Can Easily Reduce Using The Noise Reduction Feature.B. In A Room With Ceiling Fan On And Moderate Noise: Still Seems Good But Not Great. Your Vocals Would Still Be Crispy And Clear But The Background Noise Will Increase. Still If You Use Nice Noise Reduction Software (Like Audacity) It Will Sound Great. Adding Background Music To Your Video Would Help.C. In A Room With Standing Fan On And High Noise: Not Recommended At All. Not Only This Mic But Any Mic Would Capture A Ton Of Noise. To Express Statistically, There Will Be Atleast 40% Noise Of Wind Whooshing In The Background.D. The Same High Noise Room With Windows Open: You Will Die Doing Noise Reduction. Not Gonna Lie, The Background Noise Increases By 60 Times.  Dont Try This.The Pop Filter Or The Sponge On The Top Of The Mic Helps A Lot. When You Are Speaking Close To The Mic, A Lot Of Air Goes In While Speaking. So, When The ""Filter"" Is Attached, The Output Sound Does Not Have Air Whooshing But With The Filter Removed, The Output Sound Is Only Air.Now, To Sum Up...Mic Is Overall Good. Noise Cancellation Is Not Great But Yeah, For The Price Range, It Is The Best!Recording Tips:1. Record In A Silent Room With A/C Or Else Turn On The Fan At The Least Speed So It Doesn'T Make Much Noise.2. Use The Collar Clip To Place The Mic, Don'T Hold It In Hand. ( I Mean This Is Common Sense :-P )3. If Transmission Lines (Electricity Wires Which Are Above The Head) Go From Close To Your Room, I Would Recommend Changing Rooms.Now, The Reason For This Is That Sometimes, The Mic Can Catch Electromagnetic Intefrerence.  This Maono Mic Won'T Catch It But I Recommend This For Generic Mics.4. Do Noise Reduction In Audacity. It Is Very Effective Than The Inbuilt Noise Reduction Tools In Video Editors. Also, It Is Very Easy.Also, Boya By-M1 Mic Sounds Almost The Same As This Mic. There Is Only Like 2% Difference In Noise Cancellation. But, I Would Still Give Both Of Them 3 Stars For Noise Cancellation.That'S It!Hope You Understand What I Mean To Say.Peace Out.,Nice üôÇ",Https://M.Media-Amazon.Com/Images/W/Webp_402378-T1/Images/I/413Vicgpi+L._Sy300_Sx300_.Jpg,Https://Www.Amazon.In/Maono-Au-400-Lavalier-Microphone-Black/Dp/B07Jf9B592/Ref=Sr_1_237?Qid=1672903006&S=Computers&Sr=1-237

Read On!,Excellent Sound Quality, I Like This Speaker Sooooooo Much üëåüëåüëå","This Is Review Is Primarily Focused On Sound Quality.The Term Bass Is Used Losely. One Doesn'T Expect True Bass From Such Small Drivers.Shorter Version:Boat Stone 650: Very Loud. Loud And Somewhat Uneven Bass. Mids Are A Bit Supressed. Somewhat Muffled Midrange. Decent Treble. A Loud Bassy Speaker.Nakamichi Speck: Barely Louder Than The 3W Stone 200. Mids Clearer Than 650. Bass Much Much Lower Than 650. If Looking For Vfm Rule This One Out, Unless This Is On A Big Discount And Others Aren'T. Overall Fairly Even Sound, At A Questionable Price And Volume.Boat 200: More Bass Than Expected Of A Tiny 3W Speaker, But Lesser Than Speck, And Way Lesser Than 650. Excellent Midrange And Terble. Much Lounder Than What You May Expect Of A 3W Speaker. Amazing Speaker In A Tiny Package, With Insufficent Bass.Longer Version:I Have Had The 200 For Years And Many Have Asked Me To Order It For Them. It Is An Excellent Tiny Satisfying Package. The Midrange, Vocals And Treble Is Excellent, And Matches Speakers Several Times It Price. If Bass Is Not What You Are After, You Are Unlikely To Find A Better Package Even At A Much Higher Price Point, Especially If You Care For Even Sound.(By Even Sound, I Mean All Relevant Frequencies Produced Fairly Well - No Major Suppression Or Enhancement)I Checked The Others As I Usually Hear Music On A Semi-Pro System, And The Insufficent Bass (Lower-Mids) Bothered Me.Nakamichi Used To Be A Japanese Company Making Very High End Tape Decks In The 90S So The Benchmarks Were High (Now It Is A China Based Company). The 25W Raised Expectations Further. As Said, It Is Barely Louder Than The 3W Stone 200. It Is Fairly Even Sound, But Not A Significant Enough Improvement In Bass Over The 200. If You Don'T Care About The Money, And Want Something Better, Than The 200 With Even Sound, This Could Be It. The Mids And Terble, Are A Tiny Bit Better In The 200. Speck Also Has A Larger Battery, Giving Substantially Longer Backup, And Better Water Protection (Useful If You Use Yours In The Smallest Room Of The House :) )The Stone 650 Is Miles Ahead In Bass And Loudness. If That Is What You Care For, Amongst The 3 - Your Choice Is Simple. The Bass Is Uneven, However. All Three Speakers Have Memberanes In The Inner Shell Acting As Passive Bass Radiators. One Should Not Expect Much Nuance In Bass From Those. If A Thump Is What You Care For - Yes It Is Certainly There (For The Size). With Somewhat Uncontrolled Bass, The Midrange Is Compromised - Somewhat Suppressed And Somewhat Muffled. No, It Is Not Major, And Many Mgiht Not Even Really Notice It Much. The Transiton Between Mid And Lower-Mids/Bass Isn'T Great. One Usually Doesn'T Expect As Much From Such Speakers, But The Boat Stone 200 Set The Bar High - Very High.Keep The Boat Stone At An Angle Such That The Drivers (Speaker) Are In The Direction Of Your Ears. It Makes The Midrange A Bit Better. Reduces The Bass A Bit, But Makes The Sound More Even. Tough It Is Impractical To Keep It So, It Makes The Sound A Lot Closer To What I Desire.Some Extras:Placement Of These Speakers Makes A Big Difference. Keep Them About 6"" Away From A Wall (Ideally A Corner) For Enhanced Bass And Fuller Sound.If You Look At Teardown Videos, You'Ll Notice That The 650 Has Much Bigger Magnets Than The Others. It Is A Heavy Speaker. I Like That, Since It Keeps It Stable And The Rubber On The Side Helps Further. It Is Well Designed, Except The + And - Volume Buttons Should Have Been Interchanged For Intuitive Use.The 650 Can Also Be Placed Vertically. That Too Changes The Sound. Lesser Bass, And Possibly A Bit Clearer On The Whole (Reduced Bass = Less Intrusion Into The Mids, In Such Speakers)Speaker Characterics Change Subtly Over 100 Odd Hours Of Use. Often Quite Prominent In The First Hour, So Do Not Form An Opnion Before Running Them In For About An Hour.Conclusion:Nakamichi Speck: More Even Sound Than The Other Two, Not At All As Loud As Expected, Better Waterprof Rating, Bigger Battery, High Priced, Despite Chinese - Buy If You Don'T Care For The Money, Volume And Are Okay Wihtout Much Bass.Boat Stone 200: It Is A Star! Excellent Even Sound, However The Lack Of Bass As Compared To The Others Pulls It Back. If You Are On A Budget, Or If You Don'T Care Much For Bass (Especially For Lectures/Documentaries Or Vocal Music) This Is Brilliant. I Have Used It For Long.Boat 650: Heavy. Loud. Lots Of Bass.

The Best Features Once You Pair Your 3 Different Devices To This Keyboard Using Bluetooth, Switching Connectivity Is Super Fast - Like You Won'T Feel Any Lag In Connectivity. The Instructions Strap Helps To Well Understand This Product. I Bought At 2.6K, But I Know It'S Price Had Dropped To 1.7K During Diwali Sale.Things I Hate About This Product -- I Felt It Would Be Light-Weight But It Isn'T.- Buttons Are Rounded (But Yes Gives Mechanical Keyboard Feel Which Is Great)- For Gaming, Buttons Are Too Close To Each Other So Your Hands Will Take Sometime To Adjust And Also The Arrow Keys Are Slim Which Don'T Matter Because As Gamer You Rarely Use Arrow Keys (It'S Always Wasd), But Yes Will Be Problematic If You Play Fifa Where There Is Extreme Usage Of Arrow Keys.So, 4/5 For Overall Experience.,Good Portable Keyboard. I Can List Out The Pros And Cons.Pros -1. Good Connectivity With Macbook Pro Latest Os2. Macbook Keys Are Mapped Properly As Expected.3. Portable4. Simultaneous Connectivity With 3 Devicescons-1. Not An Ergonomic Keyboard. Its Flat And Doesn'T Have Any Option To Incline Up.2. Dont Have Backlight Keys. You Can Not See The Keys In Dark Room.3. Keys Are Slightly Hard To Press, I Think Due To Rubber Dome.4. Enter Key, I Feel, Is Smaller Which Cant Be Sensed Without Seeing The Keyboard.Overall, My Purpose Got Fulfilled As I Am Able To Use It With My Macbook Pro After Struggling With Logitech R270 Combo.,The Keyboard Is Really Good And It Has A Good Built Quality And The Only Con Is That There Is No Indication Of Whether The Caps Lock Is On Or Off.,Pros: Easy To Use, Keys Feels Like Mechanical Keyboard. Can Connect 3 Devices. Supports Mac And Windows. Place Holder For Mobile Devices ( However, I Use It To Place A Pen)Cons: Expensive. Very Heavy ( Feels Like Macbook Air). There Is Lag In Connection Whenever You Turn On Your Laptop.,Price Is Litter High,What An Excellent Product I Got My Hands On. Smooth Working And Connect To 3 Different Gadgets At The Same Time And U Can Work On Any Of Them. Buttons Are Of Good Size So Typing Is Easy And Fast. The Inbuilt Holder For Gadgets Is Really Solid And Helping. And It'S Connect To Iphone Also.,Only Uses For Typing If Horizontal View Is Suitable To See What We Typingthink Twice Before Buying,Not Working Properly On Macbook Pro! Switches To Junk Characters Frequently Which Is Really Frustrating!How Did I Fix ?The Keyboard Switches To Symbol/Junk Characters When The Option Key Is Pressed. So, I Had To Disable The Option Key In The Keyboard And Live With It!Apart From That Above Problem, It'S A Good Looking Keyboard. The Keys Are Smooth To Handle.

I'M Genuinely Surprised.First Of All, I'D Give This A 3.5/5 Instead Of The 4 But I Rounded It Up Instead Of Down Because There'S More To Like Than Dislike.Product Was Delivered Promptly But The Packaging Was In Rough Shape. When I Unpacked It, The Keyboard Had Three Missing Keys (Iirc It Was Left Alt, Z And The Windows Keys). I Turned Over The Box And Dumped Everything And Voila! The Missing Keys Fell Out. Not Off To A Great Start But I Slapped Those Keys On (Which Was Very Straightforward Meaning That Replacing Keycaps In The Future Will Be Relatively Easy) And Plugged In The Receiver To My Laptop. No Setup Or 3Rd Party Software Necessary, It Just Started Working Instantly. Pretty Seamless.I Only Use The Keyboard When I Connect My Laptop To My Tv And I'M Sitting At A Distance, I Use My Laptop'S Keyboard Otherwise. I Absolutely Love The Keyboard. I Was Expecting It To Feel Wonky And Cheap But It Actually Feels Decent. It'S Not Super Premium But It'S Much Better Than What I Was Expecting For The Price. It Has Flip Stands On The Back To Raise It And An On/Off Switch If You Want To Conserve Battery. The Keys Themselves Are Full Sized, And As Someone With Larger Hands, I Really Appreciate It. The Curve Around The Space Bar Looks Cool But I Don'T Think It Adds Anything Ergonomically. The Typing Experience Is Nice, The Keys Have Enough Feedback To Them (Not Mechanical Levels Obviously, But Still Satisfying Enough). The Caps Lock Key Has A Little Raised Bit To It So You Can Feel It Without Looking At It And Don'T Accidentally Hit It While Typing, Neat Little Addition. The Shortcut/Media Keys On Top All Work Fine With Windows 11. There'S Not Much Else To Say About The Keyboard. It Should Be More Than Sufficient For Everyday Office/Browsing/School Tasks And Will Be Good And Comfy For People Who Type A Lot. Do Not Buy This Expecting A Gaming Level Keyboard With Antighosting, Etc Or Buy It Expecting To Have The Durability Of A True Mechanical Keyboard. I Was Initially Going To Mark It Down For Not Having Any Backlight At All But Given The Budget, That'S Understandable And Acceptable. Overall, I Very Much Like The Keyboard And Find It To Be Above Par For What You Pay.The Mouse, On The Other Hand (No Pun Intended), Is Mediocre At Best. The Build Quality Is Not Good; It Does Not Feel Good When You Use Either Of The Click Buttons, You Can Feel The Inner Mechanisms Groaning, Like It'S Gonna Fall Apart At Any Time. The Mouse Also Starts Lagging Randomly. The Lag Only Lasts A Couple Of Seconds But It Occurs Enough To Be An Annoyance. Also, It Just Doesn'T Feel Good In Your Palm. I Have An Amazon Basics Mouse That I Purchased While I Was In The Us For $7 (~520Rs) And That Thing Feels So Much Sturdier And Better Built Than This. It Also Has No Lagging Issues And The Clicks Feel Smooth Even After A Few Years Of Use.As An Overall Package, I Would Say It'S Decent For The Price. There Are Lots Of Other Sets In This Price Range And I Picked This Literally Because Of The Logitech Branding Since I Own A Few Other Logitech Products And Enjoy Them A Lot. The Keyboard Is Doing All The Heavy Lifting Here And Carrying It'S Mouse Friend. I Hope They Improve The Mouse Going Forward Because Then, This Would Be The Best Combo In This Range. As It Stands Right Now, It'S Fairly Indistinguishable From Its Competitors.Recommended For - People Looking For An Affordable Wireless Set For Everyday Computer Work And People Who Type A Lot.Not Recommended For - Gaming Or Any Form Of Power Users. It Might Work For Single Player Games Like City Builders, Grand Strategy, Rtses, Etc But I Would Not Recommend It For Any Form Of Shooters, Especially Online. The Mouse Simply Isn'T Up To Task.,,The Keyboard Is Good And Working Nice. For Me The Mouse Is Too Small And Not Able To Use Properly And Getting Pain After Using For Very Less Time Only. It Will Be Good If The Mouse Is In Regular Size. Also The Mouse Is Lagging A Bit Even After Changing The Settings.,I Using This Product Since One Year Not Any Problem Found.Even Battery Cell Not Change,I Don'T Really Know If It'S Worth The Cost Or Not. But, I Mainly Prefer Silent Typing And Mouse Clicks. Ergonomic Is Also A Must As I Use These For Long Hours.Currently, I Use Logitech M590 Mouse Which Is Really Awesome And Makes Almost No Noise At All.,Great Product,I Have Been Using This Product For 2Years. It'S Battery Is Great, Still Running. The Keys Could Get Hard With Time, Therefore I Had To Use Wd-40 To Lubricate Them. After 2Years, Some Random Keys Have Stopped Working, Such Del, Semicolon, Numpad-3. The Mouse'S Right Click Isn'T Functioning Anymore. The Left Click Has Irritating Double Click Issue. So Not Suited For Fps Games. Speed And Connection Is Adequate, No Lag Noticed. The Keyboard Collects A Lot Of Dust So Better To Cover It. Ergonomics Are Great No Issue With That. If You'Re Looking For A Longer Size Keyboard For Approx. 2Years Of Proper Functioning For Daily Or Official Use, Then It Is A Good Purchase. Mouse Is Small And Comfortable, Even For Left Handed People. Keep In Mind The Keys Will Become Stiff Over Time.,I Purchased It For My Personal Use , Which Includes Mostly Working, It Has Good Connectivity Both For Keyboard And Mouse . I Have Not Faced Any Issue With It. I Have Not Tested Its Performanace.",Https://M.Media-Amazon.Com/Images/W/Webp_402378-T2/Images/I/41X6Hey-Exl._Sx300_Sy300_Ql70_Fmwebp_.Jpg,Https://Www.Amazon.In/Logitech-Wireless-Mk270R-Keyboard-Mouse/Dp/B00Ceqegpi/Ref=Sr_1_268?Qid=1672903008&S=Computers&Sr=1-268

I'M Using This With My Macbook It Works Fine . While Using This Adapter Amazon Prime Videos Can'T Play In 1080P Resolution On Monitor It Says The Devices Not Support Hd . Other Ports Are Working Fine Not A Problem.,I Took This For My Macbook M2 Pro 2022 Edition And It Is Working Perfectly,All The Ports Are Working Fine Till Now ,It'S Been 2 Month I Am Using It , Length Of The Wire Is Little Small It Could Be Little Big And The Price Is Also Little High It Could Be Under 900Rs ,Then It Will Justify.,If You Bought A Macbook Air Or Pro Recently And Wondering What To Do About All The Missing Ports - Usb, Hdmi Etc, This Is Your One Stop Solution.I Tried On My Macbook Air M2 And It Works Like A Charm. I Connected, Various Pen Drives, Disk Drives And A 128 Go Flash Drive - All Worked Fine.Very Reasonably Priced Compared To Other Options, Yet Has A Fairly Good Look And Feel.,Everything Working Fine But It Doesn'T Works With Macbook'S Hdmi When Try To Connect One Plus Tv As An Extended Screen( Different Displays On Both) But Works Fine If Used As Second Screen With Common Display.,Solved My Problem,I Got The Product On 11Th August 2022. This Is The Initial Impression.1) Packaging - The Package I Received Was In Good Condition. It Had A Pre Wrapped Plastic On The Box. No Complaint About Packaging But One Thing To Note Is That 'No Brand Name On The Packaging.' Although When You Open The Product , The Brand Name Is There On The Product.2) Build - Wire Length Is Small To My Opinion. It Has A Metal Build Finish And Looks Premium And Sturdy. Wire Quality Is Also Good But At This Price Should Have Provided Braided Cable.3) I Have Tested This Product With 3 Usb Ports Connected - A) Mouse B) Keyboard C)External 2Tb Ssd. Ssd Does Not Get Disconnected When All 3 Usb Are Connected. For Confirmation I Did A 2 Gb File Transfer And No Disconnections Were Noticed.Note : The Speed Of The Data Transfer Is Low. I Did 2 Gb File Transfer And Was Getting The Max Speed Of  39Mb/S With The Ssd Connected Through The Usb Hub.Although When I Did The Same File Transfer By Directly Connecting The Ssd To The Laptop Port, I Got Speed Of 111 Mb/S. So If You Want To Do Lot Of File Transfer Better Connect It Directly And Not Through The Usb Hub.So Far Initial Impression Are Good, Let See How Long It Last.,Sometimes Not Detected By Mac And Quality Is Not That Good",Https://M.Media-Amazon.Com/Images/W/Webp_402378-T2/Images/I/41Qtzxl3Kal._Sx300_Sy300_Ql70_Fmwebp_.Jpg,Https://Www.Amazon.In/Verilux%C2%Ae-Multiport-Adapter-Portable-Compatible/Dp/B09163Q5Cd/Ref=Sr_1_284?Qid=1672903008&S=Computers&Sr=1-284

Simply Put Up A Similar Replica For Something Successful But At Much Affordable Prices.If Something Isn‚ÄôT An Immediate Hit, Amazon Pulls It And Moves On.Amazon Otherwise Is Like An Online Marketplace Where It Provides A Portal For Various Sellers To Sell Their Product But With Amazonbasics - Amazon Is Selling Its Own Product At Its Own Marketplace .Here It Derives The Benefit Of Eliminating Any Intermediate Distributors Or Retailers & Hence Amazonbasics Branded Products Are Available For A Lower Price Attracting Bulk Customers Online.As An Additional Benefit, Amazonbasics Products Are Delivered Free To Prime Members & Are Covered Under Amazon Warranty For All And Hence Any Claim Or Replacement Procedures Are Highly Streamlined & Immediately Taken Care Of.About Our Product ( Requirement Vs Actual):Xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxi Recently Purchased A New Qualcomm 3 Qbix Car Charger & Was Looking For A Cable With Usb A To Micro B Connector. I Listed My Priorities Under Various Heads To Come Up With A Conclusion And Let Us Compare The Actual Product Based Upon My Initial Requirements:1.) Data Exchange:*****************************Since It Was To Be Primarily Used For Fast Mobile Devices Charging In Car, Data Exchange Capability Was Not Much Of My Concern. Preference Though Would Surely Have Been A Usb 3 But It Didn‚ÄôT Bother Me If I Could Only Get A Usb 2.0 Too.Actual Product: I Did Try To Copy A Movie File Just For The Sake Of Testing Data Exchange And I Found It To Be Pretty Well. I Did Not Capture Any Speed Data But Then We All Know Speed Of Data Transfer Also Varies With The Type Of Data Being Transferred. The More Variety Of Data Being Transferred Simultaneously The Lower Will Be The Speed.2.) Length Of The Cable :**************************************Again Since I Could Not Afford To Have A Lengthy Loop Of Cable Bunched Around My Gear Knob, I Preferred To Keep It Short & Simple Hence My Only Lookout Was Upto Around A Meter Or Below.Actual Product: The Cable Came Nicely Packed In A Paper Packet And Was Precisely 0.9 Meters Or Approximately 3 Feet Long. The Length Was Sufficient For Me To Plug-In Any Of The Mobile Devices To My Car Charger At The Drivers Or The Side Passenger‚ÄôS Seat.3.) Tangle Free/ Flexibility/ Strength Standards:**************************************************************************I Am Not Particularly A Fan Of Those Stubborn Braided Wires Which Are So Hard That They Retain The Shape In Which They Are Bent. I Wanted Something That Was Thick Yet Flexible Enough To Acquire A Circular Shape When Bunched.Actual Product: The Cable Received Looked Exactly As Shown Over The Site With Good Flexibility , Reasonable Thickness & A Sturdy Intermediate Cable. The Whole Construction Of The Cable Due It‚ÄôS Cable Size & Flexibility Is Almost Tangle-Free.The Associated Cable Was Not Exactly Thick But Can‚ÄôT Be Termed As Thin Or Delicate Too. It‚ÄôS Not The Thickest I‚ÄôVe Seen But Then Thickest Doesn‚ÄôT Always Means Most Durable. Given My Application It‚ÄôS More Than Just Suitable.The Overall Built & Quality Of The Cable & Insulation Looks Promising Enough To Last Few Years. Even If Used For Other Than Car Charging It Looks Durable Enough To Last Long.I Had Further Shortlisted Mansaa & An Amkette Cable For The Same Purpose But They Were Too Long For My Requirement.4.) Compact Moulded Connectors:*********************************************************Had An Inclination Towards Moulded Connectors To Avoid Any Issues Where The Connectors Break Open Exposing The Terminal Pcbs.Actual Product : There Are No Complaints Regarding The Connectors Of The Actual Cable. The Connectors Are Perfectly Moulded Without Any Joints Or Risks Of Splitting Open. The Connector Casings Are Further Quite Compact At Terminals To Fit In Comfortably At Scarce Spaces.The Connector Ports Are Sturdy Enough Both At Usb A & Micro B Ports. The Micro B Port Pins Lock Securely Onto The Charging Mobile Devices Which Is Quite Good.No Signs Of Loose Construction.Being Gold-Plated Is More Of A Misleading & Fancy Term(In This Case) As Most Of The Metal Ports Designed Today Already Have A Corrosion Resistance & Nobody Is Going To Use Them In Saline Sea Water Anyways.5.) Availability Of Ties/Velcro Straps :***********************************************************As Per My Intended Use In A Car Where Compactness Was Of Paramount Importance, I Expected An Included Cable Tie Or A Velcro Strap Would Be A Nice Add-On To Properly Adjust & Arrange The Cable As Per Requirement.Actual Product: This I Miss The Most In The Provided Actual Cable, There Is No Provision Of An Included Strap Or Cable Tie Through Which I Could Adjust My Required Cable Length Easily.6.) Decent Current Handling Capability:******************************************************************On The Newest Qc 3.0 Certified Chargers The Current Transmission Can Go Up To 3.4 Amps In Certain Cases Hence The Cable Needed To Have A Decent Current Handling Ability.Actual Product : The Actual Cable Has A Nameplate Rating Of Handling Up To 2.1 Amps Against Demands At New Qc 3.0 Chargers That Could Go Up To 3.4 Amps. Here, Let Me Clear Out That The Latest Qc Chargers Vary Voltage To Current Ratios To Achieve Desired Fast Charging  & Thus It Is Not Like A Continuous Flow Of 3.4 Amps Is There, It Keeps On Reducing Hence Cable Ratings Designed For A Continuous Current Handling Of Anything Above 2.0 Amps Would Sufficiently Work With Qc 3.0 Chargers.Have Tried It Safely Multiple Times Charging My Samsung S7 From 10 % Without The Cable Getting Hot.7.) Warranty:************************Comes With A 1 Year Warranty As Expected. Not The Best In The Industry But Reasonable.Other Observations:*************************************Apart From The Above Listed Features, The Other Details Of The Actual Product Received Worth Mentioning Are:8.) The Cable Is Manufactured In China & Imported By Amazon Warehouse Dealers Under The Brand Name & Philosophy Of Amazonbasics.9.) The Cable Has A Manufacturing Date Of Oct 2017 & It Was Imported To India In Dec 2017.10.) The Cable Has A Mrp Tag Of 495 Bucks However I Purchased It Online For 269 Bucks.Being A Prime Member Shipping Was Free.11.) A Customer Care Toll Free Number & Email Is Also Printed Over The Label For Registration Of Any Consumer Grievances.Final Verdict:Xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxit Has Been Few Days Since I Have Received & Been Using This Product. So Far Everything From Construction To Performance Seems To Be Convincing Enough To Recommend It And For A Price Of Around 260 I Suppose, Its Worth It.Will Surely Update If Any Malfunction Is Observed.,Worth For Buy!,The Quality That Amazon Basics At Times Give At Cheap Prices Is Beyond Imagination. Simply Superb, Goverment Shouldnt Hinder Amazon Products , Amazon Products Rather Gives Competition To Local Qualityless Products Which Consumers Are Forced To Buy Beacause They Have No Quality Competition. Make In India Is Good, But If The Make In India Products Are Simple Cheap Copies Of Branded Products Without Any Investment In R And D, Without R And D Make In India Would Never Be Successfull And Ousting Companies Like Amazon Will Only Lead To Loss For Consumers , Govt Should Infact Encourage Such Competition.,Amazon Basics Provides One Of The Best Cables Available For Charging Your Phone Or Connecting Devices.As An Past Customer Of Many Cables From Amazon This Cable Doesn'T Also Disappoint,Supports Fast Charging For All My Samsung Phones.I Use Samsung A9Pro 2016, Samsung S8Plus 2017, Which This Cable Is Compatible With .Very Sturdy, Thick And Very Long. 6 Ftvery Affordable Pricing. Thanks Amazoni Also Use A Usb C Cable For My Samsung S20Fe.,Super,Product Charging Is Ok.. However It'S Mere 1 Foot In Length..  The Vendor Could Have Mentioned  Correct Product Description.. There Is No Need To Mislead.. Too Early To Say Performance As I Have Received It Today.,Good,I Have Bought Many Cheap Chinese Micro Usb Cable In Rs 50 And Rs 100 Of Ubon And Of Many Other Chinese Local Companies,And None Of Them Worked Properly.Finall I Decided To Go For This.And It Is Charging As Well Transferring Data, Without Any Issue And I Am Very Happy With My Purchasemy Advice : Dont Buy, Cheap Chinese Local Cables Of.You Will Have To Throw Them In Dustbean After Some Time.Better Buy This One.",Https://M.Media-Amazon.Com/Images/W/Webp_402378-T1/Images/I/31Nrdwdt8+L._Sx300_Sy300_.Jpg,Https://Www.Amazon.In/Amazonbasics-Micro-Charging-Android-Phones/Dp/B07232M876/Ref=Sr_1_332?Qid=1672903011&S=Computers&Sr=1-332

As You Can See My Laptop Has A Matte Black Screen Frame And Astonishingly¬†The Product Has Merged With It. The Little Plastic Container In The Package Will Act As Storage For The Rest Of The Webcam Covers.It Is Ultra-Thin As Described By The Company With¬†Acquiring About A Millimeter Thickness. This Thickness Can Cope With The Windows¬†Laptops As They Are Having¬†The Rubber Buffers On The Top Side Of The Screen Frame Because Those Buffers Act As A Spacer Between The Screen And The Lower-Up Body/Keyboard Of The Laptop To Avoid Any Harm To The Screen.¬†This Spacer Is Advantageous To The Webcam Cover As Closing The Lid¬†Will Not Harm The Screen, Screen Frame, And Laptop Lower-Up Body. But, Still, Don'T Put Pressure On The Location Where The Webcam Cover Is Installed As The Thickness Of The Webcam Cover Is Slightly More In The Micrometers, Than The Rubber Buffers Of The Laptop Itself. The Sliding Function Is Very Smooth, But Be Sure To Push Only The Slider Part And Not The Whole Static Part As It Will Make The Grip Weak Over Time Of Usage.The Device Can Be Used With Any Phone And Monitor As They Have No Issue With Opening And Closing The Lids.Now, For The ""Mac Laptop '' Users, It Is Not A Product For Your¬†Laptop, And Never Try This Product For Your Mac Laptops. As The Mac Laptops Have A Stunning Plain Glass Screen That Is Covering The Whole Screen Frame Part And Has No Spacers, That Is There'S No Space Left After Closing The Laptop Lid And Hence Upon Installation Of This¬†Product Will Damage (Crack/Break) The Plain Glass Screen.Installation Is Easy, Remove The Blue Tape And Carefully Stick The Cover As A Sticker, Using The Scale For Support, Or Else You Could Stick It A Little Inclined. After Sticking, Rub Your Palm For Heat Generation And Grab The Screen Frame From Both Palms And Apply The Ultra-Light Pressure And Hold The Position Up To A Good 2 To 5 Minutes. And There You Go For Your Satisfied Invisible Life.*Important - Even If Not In Use, Slide It 2-5 Times Once A Week And Clean It As Per Your Device Cleaning Schedule To Avoid Jamming Due To Debris Or Dust.Overall, It Is A Good Product. For Me, It Has Worked Awesome. Green Signal From Here.Thank You :)Suggestionsto The Manufacturer - Notice The Static Frame Of The Webcam¬†Cover, And Make Its Edges (The Edges Close To The Slider) Smooth (Rounding Off Or Fillet), So That Upon Sliding The Slider With A Fat Finger, It Can Easily¬†Slide Over The Edges Of The Static Frame Hence Do Not Put An Unnecessary Force On A Static Frame.To The Seller - Well Packagingto The Consumer - Check For The Rubber Spacers/Buffers Provided In The Laptop (Like Windows Laptops), If It Is Then You Can Use The Webcam Cover, If Not (Like Mac Laptops), It'S Not The Product For You. Even For Windows Laptops, After Installing A Webcam Cover, Try Not To Put Pressure On The Webcam Cover Location For Long.

I Always Had A Fear That It Would Crack My Screen When I Close My Laptop Lid After Reading The Reviews But It'S Been 3.5 Months And There'S Not Even A Single Crack In My Screen.ùóïùòÇùó∂ùóπùó± ùó§ùòÇùóÆùóπùó∂ùòÅùòÜ ùü∞.ùü±/ùü±You Will Get 3 Webcams Covers In The Package. It'S Extremely Thin. So, It Won'T Cause Any Issues When You Close The Laptop(Hp Pavilion Gaming Used Here) But It Might Cause Issues In The Case Of Laptops With Thin Screens Like Macbook Air, Asus Tuf, Asus Rog While Closing The Lid Due To The Pressure On The Screen. At The End It'S Your Choice.ùóîùó±ùóµùó≤ùòÄùó∂ùóºùóª ùüØ/ùü±I Am Sorry To Say That The Adhesion Of This Product Is Quite Weak. It Literally Falls Off After A Week Of Applying It. I Had To Throw 2 Of It As It Became Useless. I Only Had The Last Piece Remaining.ùó¶ùóºùóπùòÇùòÅùó∂ùóºùóª ùó≥ùóºùóø ùóîùó±ùóµùó≤ùòÄùó∂ùóºùóª : Eventually I Was Able To Find A Solution For This Problem.‚Ä¢ Remove The Stock Adhesion By Gently Applying Isopropyl Alcohol.‚Ä¢ Then Apply A Strong Adhesive Glue (I Used Fevi Kwick). Apply It Only On The Back Edges Of The Webcam  Cover. Since It'S Extremely Thin, I Used Thin Needle To Apply Super Glue Gently On It Or Else The Superglue  Will Spill Out And Make A Mess.‚Ä¢ Immediately You Have To Place It On The Webcam Of Our Laptop. And Then You'Re Good To Go.Its Been 3 Months After Using The Super Glue Technique. Forget About About Falling, It Has Not Even Moved A Bit. No Effect On The Quality Of My Webcam. The Cover Won'T Interfere When You Are Using Your Webcam In Meetings. And Fully Covers It When You Want Privacy. Overall, Its A Good Product Except For The Fact That It Has Poor Adhesion.,Good Product,I Wish I Had Known This Before Ordering. Luckily A Friend Made Me Aware The Very Same Day I Had Applied It.Apple Urges People Not To Close Their Macbook, Macbook Air Or Macbook Pro, While Such Camera Covers Are Applied Because It Can Lead To Cracks In The Screen When Closing Your Macbook!!! It May Also Affect The Ambience Light Sensor, But That Is The Lesser Issue As Compared To A Potentially Cracked Screen And High Repair Costs.Macbooks Are Designed In A Way That When Closing No Foreign Object Thicker Than An Average Printer Paper (0.1Mm) Should Ever Be Between The Screen And The Body Of The Laptop. This Item Is 0.027Inches Thick, That Is 0.6Mm, Six Times The Recommended Thickness!!!If You Are Going To Use It On Your Macbook, Be Sure To Completely Remove It Before Closing Your Laptop. You Can Use It Without Worry On Imac As It'S A Desktop And Doesn'T Get Closed. You Can Also Use It With Any Normal Laptop Where The Camera Isn'T Embedded Inside The Glass Screen. If You Have A Laptop Where The Camera Is Embedded In The Plastic Frame Around The Screen It Should Be Okay.For Disappointed Macbook Users Like Me There Are Two Options. One Is You Trust Apple, Who Are Saying Their Camera Is Hardwired To The Green Camera Light. According To Them One Cannot Work Without The Other, So Even If Someone Hacks Your Camera, You Will Know It Is On Because The Green Light Will Be Glowing.If You'Re Not Sure About Their Reliability And You Still Want To Cover Your Camera, Use A Piece Of Thin Tape. Apple Does Advice Against Anything Which Could Leave Adhesive Residue On Their Screen, But Frankly, If You Just Clean It With Some Screen Cleanser After Removing, I Don'T See How There Could Be An Issue.Why Am I Still Giving This Product 3 Stars? It Reached In Good Condition, Is Easy To Install And Use, And It Will Still Be Useful To People With Other Laptops Or Desktop Screens With Inbuilt Camera. It'S Not A Bad Product. They Just Need To Stop Advertising It For Macbooks!",Https://M.Media-Amazon.Com/Images/W/Webp_402378-T1/Images/I/41Peqz-Jdsl._Sx300_Sy300_Ql70_Fmwebp_.Jpg,Https://Www.Amazon.In/Liramark-Webcam-Blocker-Computer-Macbook/Dp/B08Bq947H3/Ref=Sr_1_335?Qid=1672903011&S=Computers&Sr=1-335

Good For Living Rooms About 12X12 Ft Or Even Bigger Space. I Installed It And Connected To Tv Using Coaxial Cable. Volume, Clarity, Bass, Everything Is Perfect. Overall Value For Money Product.Long Review - I Have Experience Other Company Speakers Like Jbl And Sony And Had Decided To Buy Those, But This One Is Similar In Sound Quality. Treble Is Nice And Crisp. Vocals Sound Nice Even At Higher Volumes. Bass Is Amazing - Fills Entire Room With That Boom Sound. Watching Movies And Listening To Music Is Much Better Now With These Speakers.Used These For About 7 Days And Overall Experience Is Good.-- Sound Bar (Not Subwoofer) - Size Is Big Considering This Is 80W, But For Me This Is Perfect Size As It Matches My Tv Length And Looks Good.-- Subwoofer - Small And Compact Unit. Bass Is Amazing. Gives That Boom Effect In Action Scenes And When Listening To Music.-- Remote - Minimal But Functional Remote. Has All The Required Features In Single Click.-- Connectivity - Does Not Have Optical Spdif But That'S Ok As Coaxial Option Is Available And Mostly All Tvs Have Coax Connectivity Only. Take A Look Below For Bluetooth Connectivity. Overall Bluetooth Works Very Well, Except When You Connect Certain Devices With Newer Hardware.I Have A Smaller Unit Installed In Another Room And Always Used To Watch Movies On That Speaker Unit. But After Listening To This One, I Feel Sound, And Bass Of That Other Unit Is Just Very Low. This One Really Sounds Good And Makes Watching Movies And Listening To Music A Good Experience.Note: I Think The Unit Uses Bluetooth 4. If You Have Devices With New Bt 5.0 Drivers Or Hardware, When You Connect Such Newer Devices, Treble And Sound Quality Has Minor Issue. Not Much But Still You Can Hear It In Some Situations That Treble, And Vocals Are Not Clear. This Is Not An Issue When You Use Your Mobile To Connect Using Bluetooth.

Nothing Is Perfect. Xiaomi Has Already Released Home Security Cameras Using Other Brands Such As Yi. And The Home Security Camera Market Is Yet To Be Adapted In Large. So, You Can Expect A Lot Of Misunderstanding On How Everything Works Together In A Home Security Camera In General.Initial Setup: It Is A Breeze For Some, But Pain For Others. See The 1-Star Ratings If You Want Proof. I Had Trouble Getting This Camera Recognized By Its Own App (Mi Home). It Took About 1 Hour To Recognize After Trying With Different Lighting Conditions. The Camera Got Disconnected From The App, After I Switched The Ssid Of The Router. So, I Had To Pair It Again. This Time, It Took More Than A Day(!) Of Trial And Error. I Had To Keep The Camera Under Bright Sun Light In Order To Get Recognized By The Mi Home App. Lesson Learned In A Hard Way.Bandwidth Requirement: This Camera Requires 24X7 Connectivity With Solid Internet Connection And With Good Upload Bandwidth. Even If You Have 100Mbps Connection, This Camera Can Only Be Connected Via Wireless. So, Longer The Distance From The Router, Shorter The Bandwidth. This Camera Hangs Up, If It Doesn'T Have Enough Bandwidth. If You Add Nas Storage, You'D Need Even More Bandwidth Between The Camera And The Router. The Camera Is Very Sensitive. If You Set Up Any Conflicting Configurations, It'D Just Hang And Would Not Record Anything At All, Even In The On-Board Sd Card Storage. If The Camera Hangs For A Particular Reason, You Have To Restart It. It Is A Pain To Troubleshoot Things When You Are Miles Away From Home In Another City.Mi Home App Requires Almost All The Permissions From Your Phone. But, I Was Able To Disable Most Permissions Except Location And Storage. What'S More! You Get Ads In The App Right After Opening It (On The Dashboard Where You See The List Of Devices) Since Version 5.4.43 (Released On Dec 26, 2018). I Wish Xiaomi Released A Dedicated App For Home Security Cameras, Like Other Companies Have Done.Google Assistance Isn'T Compatible With This Camera, If You Are Into That Sort Of Thing. Some Other Cameras From Xiaomi (Not Released In India) Are Supported, Though.Once Paired To The App And Once You Have The Perfect Setup (With Nas And Good Wireless Bandwidth To / From The Camera), You May Become Addicted To Use It Under Different Conditions, Such As With Total Darkness.If You Are Technically Sound And Have Around 10K Budget, Raspberry Pi Based Home Security Is A Better Option! If You Are On A Budget And If You Don'T Want To Spend A Lot Of Time On Technical Things, Then, Xiaomi Mi Home Security Camera Is The Best Home Monitoring Camera You Can Get!,Good Enough!

As I Bought Multiple Ober The Ear Headphones There Will Be Rought Cloth Like Texture That Will Irritate Your Ears, But This One Has Soft Cushion Like Material, Im Really Comfortable With This One.*And Next The Audio Quality, I Have Previosuly Owned Boult In-Ear Earphones So I Know The Bass Quality And Vocal Quality, So I Booked This Without Even Thinking Twice, And It Has Delivered What It Can. The Best Part Is Im Really Comfortable In This One Than My In-Ear Earphones, The Sound Is Even Better And You Dont Get High Volume Levels Like Those Local Cheap Products On The Markets. But The Bass And Clarity Will Give You Some Extra Feel, Especially The Bass.. Its Really Engaging, If Ur A Bass Lover Go For It.*Then The Quality, I Know The Boult For Sometime But For Over The Ear Headphones At This Price Point I Was Little Skeptical About The Build Quality Before The Delivery And It Suprised Me, Dont Think That Build Quality Is Extraordinary Like Sennheiser Or Sony Coz Ur Not Paying That Much For This, So For This Price Its So Good, Even Better Than The Boat Headphones Which Is Slightly High In The Price Tag.Now Cons:-* Little Skeptical About The Warranty, Because When I Gone To Register This And Both While I Was Registered My Boult In-Ear Earphones, They Didnt Asked For Invoice Slips And No Serial Number Is Asked, Then How Can They Proceed If We Call For The Warranty Claims?... But Hopefully I Think This Will Last Long As Seeing The Quality.* Next Is The Cable Quality, I Didnt Complaining About It, But They Mentioned In Amazon As Its An Kevlar Cable, So I Expected A Lott But Its A Normal Cable Bt Its Sturdy Enough.*** I Didnt Check The Mic On It, I Make A Call On This, The Other Person Was Able To Understand Me, But I Dont Know Hows The Quality.To Help You Guys, I Have Metioned Every Aspect In Detailed Manner So It Can Helpful For People Who Spend Their Valuable Money (Coz Every Single Rupee Counts)..Have A Nice And Safe Shopping.

This Is A Generic Item Sold By Slapping Diff Brand Names Like Zinq, Quantum (Available Right Here On Amazon) & Prolly More. Even The Boxes R Exactly Same... Lol.2. Recharge Rate Is Horribly Slow @0.5A, So 2.2Ah Will Take 4.4Hrs, Considering Losses 4.5Hrs. That'S Why Frequent Power Cut Ppl R Complaining About 1Hr Standby. So Its Basically For Ppl With Occasional Power Cuts (Like Me With Community Generator).3. Ups Has To Be Turned On To Recharge... What? Why? Lame! This Is Another Reason Ppl R Complaining About Charging Issue & Since Item Is Generic, Zinq Prolly Doesn'T Even Know... Lol... Such A Dumb Thing Must Be Printed On The Center Of The Box Itself.

However, For Now, The Company Has Taken On Wireless Headphones In An Affordable Form ‚Äî Neckband-Style Earphones. The Headset Has A Flexible Neckband With Metal Modules At The Ends, Short Cables That Lead To The Earbuds, And The Plastic Earbuds Themselves. We Quite Liked The Yellow-And-Black Colour Scheme Of Our Review Unit. The Design Is Simple And The Build Quality Is Decent. The Device Is Light At Just 30G, And Comfortable To Wear And Use For Long Hours At A Stretch.Like Earlier Realme Earphones, The Realme Buds Wireless Have Magnets In Each Earbud. While They Don'T Serve Any Purpose On The Wired Models Beyond Keeping The Two Earbuds Together, The Magnetic Clamp Serves As The Power Switch For The Realme Buds Wireless. Separating The Buds Turns The Headset On, While Attaching Them Powers It Down; There Is No Power Button, So This Is The Only Way To Control Power On The Headset.In Theory This Sounds Good, But The Weak Magnets Meant That The Earphones Separated Easily When Placed In A Bag Or Pocket. This Would Turn The Earphones On And Automatically Connect With Our Paired Smartphone Even When We Didn'T Want It To, Which Was Bothersome. Calls Would Be Automatically Diverted Away From The Smartphone'S Earpiece Without Us Knowing, The Battery Would Run Down, And The Phone Wouldn'T Automatically Connect To Other Devices Such As A Bluetooth Car Audio System.What You Do Get In The Sales Package Are Three Pairs Of Silicone Ear Tips, Ear Wings That Are Pre-Attached To The Earbuds, And A Micro-Usb Cable For Charging. The Charging Port Is On The Underside Of The Right Module, Which Also Has The Controls For Playback, Calls, And Volume.The Realme Buds Wireless Earphones Are Powered By 11.2Mm Drivers, With Bluetooth 5 And Support For The Sbc And Aac Codecs. The Earphones Have A Claimed Battery Life Of 12 Hours On A Single Charge, And Are Said To Offer 100 Minutes Of Listening Time On A 10-Minute Charge When The Battery Is Drained. We Were Able To Get Around 9 Hours Of Use In Our Testing, While A Full Charge Of The Headset Took A Little Under 3 Hours To Complete.ü§©ü§©ü§©üî•  (Realme Buds Wireless Performance)The Realme Buds Wireless Bring A Refreshing Change To The Budget Segment, Offering A Great Combination Of Design And Sound Quality For The Price. Also, Fans Of Electronic Music Will Be Happy To Know That The Realme Buds Wireless Have Been Tuned With Inputs From Popular Dj Alan Walker, And The Sound Does Come Across As Geared For This Genre. The Wireless Earphones With Use Aac Bluetooth Codecs. We Listened To Streamed Music From Spotify And Youtube Music, As Well As Our Collection Of High-Resolution Tracks.üéßüéõÔ∏èüé∂Starting With Take Five By The Dave Brubeck Quartet, We Immediately Noticed That The Soundstage Was Considerably Wider And More Detailed Than What We'Re Typically Used To Hearing From Products In This Price Range. Some Of The Percussion Instruments Sounded Crisp And Well Defined, Although The Deeper Elements In The Middle Of The Track ‚Äî The Double-Bass, In Particular ‚Äî Was A Bit Soft And Not Quite As Distinct As We'D Have Liked. Still, We Found The Sound To Be Detailed And Rich On The Whole.Next, We Listened To A Bit Of Indian Pop With An Unplugged Rendition Of Amar Arshi'S Kala Chasma. Apart From Some Gentle Aggression In The Low End, We Also Quite Liked The Inoffensive Nature Of The Mids And Highs, As Demonstrated With The Familiar Vocals Of The Track. The Sound Of The Realme Buds Wireless Is Tuned For Comfort And Near-Universal Appeal, And Sticks To That Brief. We Heard Just About As Much Detail And Clarity As We Could Have Hoped For From A Pair Of Wireless Earphones That Cost Less Than Rs. 2,000.The Realme Buds Wireless As A Hands-Free Headset For Voice Calls, And Results Were Mixed. In Some Cases We Found That Voices On The Other End Of The Call Were Soft, And Our Callers Reported Too Much Background Noise ‚Äî A Crow Cawing About 20 Feet Away Sounded As If It Was Coming From Right Next To Us, For The Person On The Other End. On Other Occasions, No Issues Were Reported, So Call Quality Seems To Be Largely Dependent On Your Surroundings And Possibly The Strength Of Your Cellular Signal.  (Verdict)More Expensive Pairs Of Earphones Such As The Oneplus Bullets Wireless 2 And 1More Stylish Dual Dynamic Driver Might Offer Much More By Way Of Sound Quality, But The Realme Buds Wireless Does A Capable Job For Just Rs. 1,799. This Is A Product Worth Considering Simply Because It Is Everything You Need For The Price.This Headset Is Built Well, Has Decent Battery Life, And Is Very Comfortable To Wear. The Only Significant Problem For Us Was The Magnetic Power Switch, Which Often Led To The Earphones Automatically Powering On At Awkward Times. That Aside, The Realme Buds Wireless Is A Pair Of Earphones That Does Exactly What It'S Supposed To - No More And No Less ‚Äî With Unwavering Consistency, And We Like It For That.Pros‚ö´1  Looks Goodüî•2  Light And Comfortable3  Detailed, Rich Sound For The Pricecons‚ö´1  Magnetic Power Switch Is Troublesome2  Inconsistent Performance On Voice Callsratings (Out Of 5)Design/ Comfort: 4.0Audio Quality: 3.8Battery Life: 4.5Value For Money: 4.8Overall: 4.0Go And PurchasedüôÇüëç,First Of All If You Are A Electronic/Dance And Hip/Hop Genre Kind Of Enthusiast Than Your Search For A Good Quality Earphone """"Still Continues"", It'S Not Like These Earphones Are Worthless For These Genres And Cannot Be Listened On These, Surely You Can Listen And Enjoy It But You Just Could Not Get The Vibes You Get While Listening Those On Deep Base Earphones.From My Music Listening Experience From 8 Years I Can Tell You That The Depth And That Vibrating+ Surround Base Effect Is Not In This ( It Surely Has Some Thumpy Bass Which Is Required For Perfect Balance In Every Genre) But Due To Lack Of That Deep Base You Will Definitely Regret Your Purchase If You'Re A Hip/Hop &Edm Lover (The Mid Tones Of Music Are A Little Low In This Earphone Which Also Ruins A Little The Experience Of These Genre'S Song Listening Experience).This Wanna Makes Me Think Everytime Is Alan Walker Really Tuned This???For Trap & Hard Dance Genre It'S Good But Not The Best.I Can Tell You Such Differences Because I Am Also Using A Wired Earphone Namely Mi Earphones Pro (1799 Rs) Which Is Excellent And Produces Very Great Sound For Every Genre And Definitely Have That Deep Base Effect!!Rather Than For Those Genre'S Song These Earphones Are Really Good For Every Other Genres !!!If You'Re Fine With The Above Listed Drawbacks Then Only Head Towards The Detailed Review!!:::::::Upsides:::::::1. The Material Quality Is Good, Its Plastic But Feels Like A Soft Silicon Layer Is Applied Over Its Top Layer (Both On The Neckband As Well As The Wires Of The Earplugs).2. These Are Extremely Lightweight And Doesn'T Feels A Like Extra Load On Your Neck At All.3. Noise Cancellation Is Really Very Good, I'M Really Impressed.4. Mic Quality Is Also The Best That Can Be Offered In 2000 Range (No Complaints)5. The Earplugs Fit Is Good (But I Advice You To Remove Those Removable Angular Paddings For More Snug Fit) And Comfort Is Fine (But Could Be More Better As My Wired One'S Are Really More Comfortable And If You Have Also Experienced Something More Comfortable Than This, Then You Can Also Complain About It'S Comfort For Long Use).6. The Blutooth Range Is Really Good (Still Works If 2 Rooms Are In Between)7. The Magnetic On/Off Control Is Like Cherry On Cake And Works Like Charm!(When You Seperate Them It Takes 3-4 Seconds To Connect With Your Phone If Already Paired Before And If Phones Bt Is On, And If You Attach Them Together They Go To Standby Mode And Goes Off If Not Opened Again Within 5 Minutes, It'S Really Good That You'Re Getting This Magneticfunction In This Price!!)8. Sound Can Go Really Loud But I Prefer To Use It On 60-70 %9. Micro Usb Cable + 2 Pair Of Extra Eartips (Small & Large) Are Provided In Box (Medium Is Pre-Applied And Is Perfect Nearly For Everyone)10. Battery Backup Is Good (Expect 8 Hours Of Continuos Playback On 70% Volume)11. Charging Speed Is Also Good, You Can Easily Get 1 Hour Of Playback On 1O Minutes Of Charge!, And Can Fully Charge It Around 90-100 Minutes If Fully Empty.12. Did Not Get To Experience Its Splash Retention Property.::::::Downsides::::::1. The Outer Cover Of Earphones Are Of Plastic (Good Quality), But They Would Have Given Aluminium Frame In This Price.2. The Wires Should Also Be Given As Braided One (For Rough And Long Use)3. No Realme Branding (Permanent) Anywhere On The Earphone Confuses Us, But There'S Tag Attached On The Neckband4. The Cap On The Charging Port Should Have Given To Prevent Dust From Entering.5. Small Carry Case Or Pouch Should Have Been Given To Make It Travel Friendly6. When Connected To The Device When There Is An Incoming Call It Doesn'T Recites The Number Of Caller, And It Sometimes Doesn'T Notifies At All... **But No Major Con Is There**:::::::::::::::::::::::Sound Quality:::::::::::::::::::::::::1. The Vocals Are Really Amazing & Now I Definitely Understand The Lyrics Of Pop Songs üòÜ.2. The Lows And Highs Of The Songs Are Really Great But Mids Are Little Supressed And You Would Definitely Miss That In Edm And Hip-Hop Songs (As That Evary Low Details Are Not Required In Dance Songs, The Mids & Highs Are More Important)3. The Base Is Adequate And Keeps The Song Alive But Not Produces That Well Deep And Surround Base That Youngster'S Love, But It Definitely Has That Amount Of Base Required In Any Song To Feel It, I'M Also A Younster And I'M Fine With It As I'Ve Bought It As A Secondary Earphone For Watching Movies And Series On Tv Silently Without Disturbing My Family So This Fulfills My Purpose.4. The Beat And Sound Produced Feels Natural And Clear Like High Quality Headphones And In This Respect Alan Walker And Realme Team Had Surely Done A Great Work.5. Based On Types Of Music Lovers I Would Recommend This To:- Pop, Indie-Pop, Acoustic, R&B, Rock And Soft Rock, Trap/Hard Dance & Nearly All Kinds Of Genres Except Edm And Hip-Hop...As I'Ve Bought It As A Secondary Earphone So I Do Not Had Any Great Expectations And I Can Surely Say That It Exceeded My Expectations And I'M Very Happy With My Purchase....Please Read The Whole Review It Will Surely Help You Decide More Clearly.Have A Good Purchasing Experience, Thakyou For Reading!!!,Best But Little High Price.6To 12 Month Daily Use He Chal Pata H ..,The Base Is So Loud. You Can'T Listen For Long, You Will Get Ear Pain After 1 Hour. Who Like Highhhhhhhhh Base They Can Choose And Sound Quality Ok.

I Have Bought A Couple Of Honor Fitness Bands Earlier For Family, But This Is My Personal First. I Have Been Keenly Following The Smartwatch Space For The Last 10 Months Or So And I'M Aware Of Most Of The Products In The Budget Range. While I Can Afford A Slightly More Expensive One (Gts2/Gtr2 Or Honor Gt2 Pro, Oppo Watch, Fitbit Etc) With Calling Feature, I Wanted To Get The Feel Of A Smartwatch In The Budget Range First. I Gave A Lot Of Thought And Finally Bought This One As It Included Gps And Amazon Alexa (Yet To Be Included, But Must Be Available Through An Ota Update). I'D Have Loved To Buy Amazfit Bip U Pro As It Has Almost The Same Features With An Lcd Display (Has Gps And Alexa In The Global Version Named Amazfit Pop Pro). It Still Isn'T Released In India.Coming To The Watch'S Performance, The Typical Features I Tried Today (First Day) Are Heart Rate (Hr), Spo2, Stress Monitoring And Gps. I Have A Pulse Oximeter From Dr. Trust At Home And So I Could Compare The Hr And Spo2. The Numbers On The Watch Aren'T Very Accurate To My Surprise (Heart Rate Variation By 5-10 Bpm And Spo2 Percentage Off By 10% Points At Times) . But I Still Feel It'S More To Do With Calibration And The Way These Numbers Are Measured Than Inaccuracy Of The Hardware Etc. Gps Was A Breeze As I Walked On The Terrace Of My Rural Town House. It Won'T Surprise Me If I Don'T Get The Same Performance In A Metro City With A Lot Of High Rise Apartments Etc. The Compass Worked Fine When I Compared It With My Phone. Music Controls Worked Fine, Bluetooth Data Transfer Or Sync Was Good. I Couldn'T Control The Phone Camera As I Couldn'T Get That Feature To Work (Refer To Image And Help Me If You Can). I Didn'T Face Any Issue With Watch Vibration During Calls And App Notifications. The Readability On The Watch Screen Has Been Really Good. Tried A Couple Of Workouts. While The Step Count Seems To Be Fine, Not Sure Of The Accuracy Of The Stats On Other Workout Modes.To Conclude, I Wouldn'T Say That This Watch Is A Disappointment, But It Needs Improvements On The Accuracy Of The Fitness Stats. Probably I Should Give It More Time, But Fitness Brands Have Done Better In Terms Of Accuracy (At Least The Honor Bands I'Ve Seen). Eagerly Waiting For Alexa Update As I'M Curious What All It Can Do.I Would Love To Update My Review After Using The Watch For Few More Days. Let'S See.Update (8Th Jan 2021): The Battery Is A Clear Disappointment As Many Other Users Pointed Out. I'M Hardly Getting It For 3.5 Days With Always On Display And An Occasional Workout. Limited Watch Faces, Both On Device (4) And The App (57). Not Many Out Of These 57 Do Justice To The Good Display. Waterproof Nature Of The Device Is Good. I Didn'T Dip It In Water, But It Got Wet When I Was Bathing My Kids And It Seems To Have A Waterproof Coating Which Was In Action. I Got The Camera Shutter To Work. I Hope Amazfit Provides Updates To Fix Battery Drain And Enable Alexa. Notifications Didn'T Have An Issue, But Could Not Clear Individual Items (Clear All Worked),Review Of Amazfit Gts 2 Mini Smart Watch (2021 Model)Hello Everyone . Since The New Model Of Amazfit Gts2 Mini Arrived , I Am Going To Review The Old Model Of Itpros:Display : 1.55 Inch Amoled Display , Really Good Look . ( Pros)Battery : Coming With 220 Mah , From 100 Percent To 13 Percent It Takes 10 Days To Drain And It Was Expected To Last 1 Day Longer ( Normal Use ) . But If You Are A Light User ,It Can Last It For 14 Days . (Pro)Ip Rating :Ip 68 Water Resistant Which Is Cool .(Pro)Heartbeat Sensor : It Has Heartbeat Sensor And It Is Real , But It May Not Show Real Accuracy At All The Time . But It Performs Good (Pro)Comfortness : It Is Really Comfortable Wearing This Watch And The Band Is Silicone Material. (Pro)Work Out Modes : There Are Nearly 70+ Workout Modes And I Tested Out Some , Since It Is Built In Gps , It Works Nearly Accurate But The Measure Is Not That Much Accurate But It Works Well. (Pro)Can Track Stresshas Pai Feature To Progress Your Workout With Better Experiencealexa Assistant ( But Need Phone Connection To Activate This )Has Other Modes Like Breathing ,Menstrual Cycle Tracking,To-Do-List , Inbuilt Alarm ,Pomodoro Timer ,Sleep Tracker ,Timer , In Built Compass , Camera Remote ,Find The Phone , Controlling Music Etc.Notification System : You Can Get Notifications .Call Control System : You Can Accept Or Reject Calls , But You Cannot Able To Talk Through Watch.Cons:Build Quality :It Is Told That This Watch Is Completly Aluminium Frame But It Is Quite Disappointing That Only Half Frame Is Gun Metal Aluminium . And Half Is Poly Carbonate (Con) .Watch Faces : The Inbuilt Watch Faces Are Quite Depressing At Initial Impressions But There Are Some Watch Faces That Are Really Good . (Con)Spo2 : I Don'T Know How Much Accurate It Is , But Coming To Technical Part , The Sensors Are Failing Most Of The Times . Sometimes Cannot Able To Sync Workout History .(Con)Verdict :It Is Not A Bad Idea To Spend Money For This Watch Due To Immense Features And Real Sensors But You Should Compromise On Sensors Efficiency And Build Quality .,The Incoming Call Notification Disconnects If You'Re Away From The Watch Even Though Other Notifications Are Displayed In The Watch. I Have Accidentally Hit The Display Of The Watch While Walking In Walls And Steel Doors, Even Though It'S Not Damaged. Water Resistance Is Good. I Used To Wash Dishes Wearing It. No Use Of Alexa.I Think It'S A Good Buy After 2 Months Of Usage,All Over Amazfit Gts2 Mini (New Version) Is Good But Price Is High And Also Calling Features Not Available That Is The Biggest Drawback.

Sound Is Average Iam Using Soundbar So No Issues For Me. Don'T Know How Long It Will Last Due To My Previous Mi 55 4 Pro Panel Gone In 2.5 Years. Bought This Tv With 2 Year Warranty On Panel.,Improve The Software Response And Improve The Picture Quality. Worth For Money For This Budget (4K).,I Have Used 2-4 Days. Picture Quality Looks Good And Impressive. Go For It..Hope Long-Term Quality Is Also Good.,This Tv Is Very Good But In This One Thing Bad Is Tha This Tv Some Time Get Stop While Playing Only Youtube Video But Otherwise It'S A Good Product,It‚ÄôS Good And Value For Money,Amazing Pic And Sound Quality. 4K Quality At This Price.

The Coverage Never Dropped And Was Mostly Consistent.However It Suddenly Developed Some Snag And Stopped Connecting To The Internet. Apparently The Ethernet Port Got Damaged Somehow. I Tried Calling Tp Link Service Center Numbers And Realised How Bad Their Service Is. It'S The First Time In My Life That A Router Has Broken And That Too After Just Over A Year'S Usage. And To Make It Worse There'S Dismal After Sales Service.I Tried To Buy A Replacement From Tp Link But That Router Came With Problems As The Connection Wasn'T Stable. I Think I'Ll Finally Look Towards Other Router Makers And Avoid Tplink Product Until Maybe They Start Caring More For Their Costumers. Hopefully I'Ll Find A Good Maker .,Good Router,After Researching Lot I Settled On Tp Link A6,I Was Looking For Better Range Router, This Router Really Worth The Price. Dual Band, Guest Wifi. I Upgraded From Tenda N301, And Performance Is Really Good.Range For 5Gz Is Not That Good As 2.5Gz But Which Is Accepted And No Other Routers In This Range Can Provide Better Than This.,I Was Using Tenda Ac 10 Router (Since 2019) For 100Mbps Connection From Local Isp (Mach1 Broadband, Mumbai). Most Of Devices (5 Mobiles, 4 Laptops, 1 Firestick) At My Home Work On 5Ghz Except 1 Cctv Camera. Range Of Tenda Ac 10 Was Good And Used Digisol Ac750 Repeater For Farthest Room Of My 2 Bhk Home.In Recent Lightning Strike In Mumbai, Power Adapter Of Tenda Ac10 Got Burned Out And Performance Issues Creeped In With Replacement Adapter. I Was Searching For Router With Good Range And Speed Within My Budget. I Tried 2 Routers (Mercusys Ac1900 Mr50G & Tp Archer C80 Ac1900) Before This. Both Routers Didn'T Meet My Expectation. Range And Speed Of These 2 Routers Were Poor Than My Earlier Tenda Ac10. Amazon Accepted Returns Without A Single Question. Thumbs Up To Amazon.After Some More Research, I Zeroed On Tp Link Archer A6 & C6. As Per Comparison On Tp Link Website Both Are Identical Routers. After Doing Some More Research On Blogs And Reviews, I Found That Archer A6 Is The Latest Model And Had Slightly Better Processor (Both From Qualcomm). Hence Purchased Archer A6. Feature Of Onemesh Is Added Advantage For Adding Onemesh Repeaters In Future. Separate Wifi Ssid (With Same Strength On Both 2.4 & 5 Ghz) As Unnamed Wifi Can Be Seen On Wifi Analyser, As Per Tp Link Support Page, This Is Dedicated Wifi Link For Onemesh Repeaters.Now For Router, Router Is Same As Tenda Ac10 For Coverage, It Can Not Cover Farthest Room In 2Bhk On 5Ghz. 2.4 Ghz Band Can Cover 2Bhk House, But Speed Is Around 30 Mbps On 100 Mbps Plan. However, Speed On Archer A6 Is Better That Tenda Ac10. I'M Getting 90 Mbps Upload And Download Consistently On Devices 5~15 Feet Apart In 5Ghz. Tp Link Archer A6 Is Better Than Costlier Ac1900 Routers. Just For Info, I Received Us Version (V2) Of Router Instead Of Eu Version Mentioned On Tp Link India Website. Hence, Firmware On Tp Link India Website Will Not Match With Device Firmware. However, This Device Has Auto Update Option Directly From Internet. Also, Router Can Be Managed By Tp-Link Tether App Remotely (On Internet Even Tough Not Connected On Same Wifi) By Login Using Tp Link Account On Both Router And Tether App.By Trying So Many Routers, I Understood That 5Ghz Range Will Be Week Even With Costliest Router. Instead Of Using Digisol Ac750 Repeater, I Installed My Old Tenda Ac10 In Repeater Mode For 5Ghz (2.4 Ghz Disabled). Now My Complete Home Is Covered By 5Ghz Signal. In The Farthest Room I Receive Download & Upload Speed Of Around 75 Mbps.I Also Tried Old Tp Link Archer C50 Which I Had Purchased When Abroad, Performance Is Not Good In Terms Of Speed And Range As It Lacks Gigabit Ports, Beam-Forming & Mu-Mimo.My Isp Has Connected My Link On Gigabit Port Of Their Switch In My Society. However, Cabling Is Only 2 Pair Cat 5E Which Supports Max 100 Mbps (Full Duplex). I Will Try To Get Cabling Changed To Either 4 Pair Cat 5E Or Cat6 From Isp And Check The Performance. I Will Update Review After Cabling Change.So In The Nutshell I Would Recommend To Go For Router With Gigabit Ports, Beam-Forming & Mu-Mimo Even If Your Internet Speed Is Less Than 100Mbps As It Is Future Proof. Tp Lnk Archer A6 Is Good Router Meeting All Requirement Within The Budget.Hope This Review Is Useful In Search Of Good Future-Proof Router.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Edit 1:My Isp Tried To Replace My Connection To Ftth And This Router Was Connected To Fiber Onu Using Gigabit Port. It Worked Only For 15 Mins. Max Speed Was 230 Mbps. Isp Was Not Able To Resolve The Ftth Issue And Changed Cable To 4 Pair Cat-5E, Which Supports Gigabit Transmission. Now Net Speed Is Around 160 Mbps. My Internet Plan Is 100 Mbps. I'M Happy With The Speed. I Have Asked Isp To Change My Connection To Ftth At Last. Tenda Ac10 Is Now Working As Wired Repeater Connected On Gigabit Port Of Archer A6 Using Cat5E Cable. Now Complete Home Received Stable Wifi Of 160 Mbps On 5Ghz Band.I Will Update Once Again When Ftth Connection Is Successful.,Good Product Till Now 1 Month,I Am Very Satisfied.,I Am Really Satisfied With This Product As Earlier My Phone Is Keep Getting Wifi Disconnected And I Used To Reconnect It And The Same Way Vpn  Is Keep Getting Reconnecting In My Laptop Hence My Teams Call Used To Disconnect During The Meeting.. Now I Am Happy With This Product Where My Vpn Is Not Reconnecting Even Internet Goes Down And If Any Flatuations In The Network As Well.. Finally I Am Not Seeing Any Issue With This Router..

Price Is Little High,I Have Been Using This Mouse Since 2019, And I Have To Say, Logitech Built Quality Is Second To None.I Have Throwed, And Bashed This Mouse On My Table During My Gaming Sessions, Yet This Mouse Still Survives.Even The Rubberised Grips Are Still There. Go For It Without Any Hesitation.For Those Having Button Issues, I Have So Far, Replaced My Left Click And Middle Click Button . I Started Developing These Issues After 2 Years . It'S A Simple Soldering Job To Fix It. You Can Get Replacement Switches From Tanotis. Now They Work As Good As New.,,So I'Ve Been Using This Mouse For Quite A Long Time And Believe This Is The Best Mouse So Far I'Ve Ever Used. But The Problem Is With The Cable, As Another Customer Said The Cable Quality Is Not Good The Outer Portion Of Cable From Usb And From Mouse Side Coming Out And The Inside Wires Can Be Visible. Even Though Mouse Runs Good But This Is Not Good For Long Term Usage. Other Than This Is Pretty Good Mouse We Have.,At Close To 150G, It Is Ridiculously Heavy For Fast-Paced Gaming. For Chill Rpg Titles It'Ll Do Fine, But If You Wanna Play Something Like Apex Legends On This, Forget It. The Shape Of The Mouse Is Super Comfortable, Only Mouse I'Ve Owned That Didn'T Give Me Any Wrist Pain Even After 4-5 Hours Continuous Usage. Cable Quality Is What You Expect, Like It'S Not Even Braided. Since, It'S An Older Generation Mouse, It Doesn'T Have The Double-Clicking Issue Logitech Is Infamous For.After All That, I Would Say In 2022, Just Don'T Buy It, It'S Too Old To Justify Spending Any Money On.,You Know And Love Logitech. This Is One Of Their Best Products.,I'D Say This Is Hands Down My Favorite Budget/Gaming Mouse. It'S Nice And Comfy, Works Properly, And Also Has Multiple Buttons To Assign Them To Various Actions, Which Is Not Just Limited To Games, You Can Assign Them To Windows Actions As Well.Have Been Using This For The Last 2 Years And I Have Absolutely No Complaints, Although My Brother Thinks That It Looks Like A Beetle :)",Https://M.Media-Amazon.Com/Images/W/Webp_402378-T1/Images/I/31Nlfclyn7L._Sx300_Sy300_Ql70_Fmwebp_.Jpg,Https://Www.Amazon.In/Logitech-Hyperion-Ultra-Gaming-Mouse/Dp/B00Nfd0Etq/Ref=Sr_1_424?Qid=1672903016&S=Computers&Sr=1-424

The Quality Is As Expected From Logitech,Cool Keyboard,Not Worth The Hype, But Manageable,A Robust, High-Quality, Ergonomic Keyboard.,The Best Keyboard For A Mac Environment","So I Got This Keybaord A Few Days Ago And It Came In A Package That Can Be Best Described As Being Mauled By A Bear. It Was Totally Beaten Up And Inside The Batteries Of The Keyboard Ha Come Loose Alsothough I Could Just Pop It Back In No Problem. Thankfully It Works Fine, I Tested All The Keys And They Are Functional So Let'S Get To The Meat Of The Subject, Or Paneer If You'Re Vegetarian:I Think This Keyboard'S Performance Will Vary According To Your Use Case. For Me The Primary Objective Was To Get An Android Compatable Keybaord Since I Had Shifted The Majority Of My Wokrload From My Laptop To My Tablet. I Checked The Internet And Settled On This Little Guy Becaue Of Teh Glowing Reviews And From My Friend Who Had The Ink Variant Of The Keyboard. I Bought It Along With The Logitech Pebble M350 Wireless Mouse Since It Came In A Bundle And Honestly I Don'T Regret It. Both Of Them Fir Very Well Into My Work Type And They'Ve Made My Life A Lot More Easier.This Is Of Course A Bluetooth Keyboard And It Does Not Have Any Wireless Dongles Hidden Away In The Chasse(I Checked). The Keyboard Has No Backlighting As Expected From A Wireless Eyboard That Runs On Regular Pen Torch Batteries, And From My Friends Experience This Battery Will Last You A Long Time. The Major Feature Of This Wireless Keyboard Over The Other Brands In Teh Market Is The Ability To Switch Between 3 Bluetooth Capable Devices With The Press Of A Button. Now I Personally Thought That I Wouldn'T Be Using This Feature All That Much Since I Was Plaaning On Using This Keyboard For My Android Tablet. But Then I Realised That, I Could Set Up My Laptop As A Second Device And Switch Between My Tablet And Laptop Without Any Issues Making It Easier To Type Out Papers On My Laptop And Responding To Texts, Emails On My Android Tablet At The Same Time. Nowadays I Can'T Stop Using This Feature Since I Have My Phone, Tablet And Laptop Paired To This Keybaord And My Productivity Has Become Much More Efficent. It Is Honestly Very Neat.The Keys Are Rounded Which Is Much More Pleasant To Type On Than Let'S Say Square Keys, And The Slight Inclination Of The Keyboard Serves As Good Angle That Reduces Finger Fatigue While Typing. This Comes With No Wrist Rest So People Who Have Had Hand Injuries Should Either Look For Another Keyboard Or Buy The Wrist Rest Seperately. Teh Keys Are Membrane Keys And They Feel A Bit Stiff In My Honest Opinion, But Nonetheless It Has A Good Feedback And The Typing Experience Is Very Comfortable. It Does Not Have A Number Pad As You Migth Have Seen From The Product Images, So If You Are Someone That Crunches A Lot Of Numbers Ine Excel You Might Want To Skip This Keyboard.The Latency Is Quite Low From My Perspective, I Don'T Think They Have That Crispy Logitech Lightspeed Tech Built Into It Though, But You Won'T Be Using This For Gaming, And If You Are Planning To Then Please Don'T. This Keyboard Performs Horribly In Gaming, And I Mean It'S Terrible. This Is A Keybaord Targeted At People Who Do A Lot Of Typing Across Multiple Devices And It Is Built With Portability In Mind. If I Am Ambitious Enough I Can Probably Stuff This Keyboard Into My Pocket, Because Of How Small It Is. Like My Friends Say I Have Small Hands, Well This Keyboard Was Probably Designed For A Rat Because My Hands Are Huge Compared To This Keybaord. Sometimes While I Am Resting My Hand On The Homerow My Ring Finger Accidentally Presses One Of Teh Mushy Media Buttons At The Top And Everything I Am Doing Goes Into Stasis. But That Is More Of A Me Problem Than A Problem With This Keyboard. It Does Come With Arrow Keys Which Is Very Surprising. They Actually Managed To Squeeze It In.I Mean That'S Pretty Much It For This Keybaord. Don'T Buy It For Rs.3K I Suggest Waiting For A Discount Because This Thing Is Certainly Not Worth That Much. I Would Say This Is Like A Rs.1.4K Keyboard But That'S Just My Opinion. If You Are Buying This For The Android Experience Then I Suggets Buying It Bunded With The Mouse. Because Both Of Them Kind Of Complete Each Other. With That Being Said I'M Going To Conclude My Review.,Mouse Came Turned On. Apart From That No Issues Discovered Till Now, It Going Good.,It‚ÄôS One Of The Best Budget Keyboards I Have Ever Used.. The Membrane Keys Are Very Soft And Easy To Click‚Ä¶ Not Lift Off Weight ‚Ä¶ Easy On The Fingers ‚Ä¶ It‚ÄôS Been Around 1Yr Since I Bought This Keyboard ‚Ä¶ And Iam Using It Ever Since ‚Ä¶ No Issues So Far And Iam Highly Satisfied With My Purchase‚Ä¶ Definitely Gonna Recommend It ‚Ä¶. Very Good Typing Experience So Far,Https://M.Media-Amazon.Com/Images/I/61Liml3Ts4L._Sy88.Jpg,Cons:No Caps Lock Indicatorheight Isn'T Adjustableno Backlight,The Key Travel Is Very Very Less, Please Keep That In Mind. Otherwise A Decent Product At The Price Range.,I Bought This In Combination With A Logitech Pebble M350 Bluetooth Mouse For The Sole Purpose Of Using It With My Ipad. It Has Made My Tasks Easier And With Recent Ipados Updates, There Are Tons Of Shortcuts That Make Ipad Experience More Productive. Since I Was Going For A Retro-Looking Device, I Chose Sand Color. Makes Me Nostalgic About The Old School Computer Devices That Had Similar Finish. Connectivity Is Fast. You Just Switch It On And It'S Connected To Your Primary Device In A Matter Of Seconds, Even Less. They Keys Are Not Silent But At The Same Time Not Loud Enough To Disturb Your Environment.You Can Connect Upto 3 Devices And Switch Between Them Seamlessly With The Push Of A Button. I'M Also Using The Setup For Gaming. Will Maybe Update Later About That Experience.Final Comments: Ergonomic, Economic, Portable And Lovely! Recommend Buy For All Who Need To Get Work Done Fast.,This Keyboard Is Awesome , It Has A Flawless Connectivity And A Great Size For Portability . Just That It Is Not Fitted With A Lift At The Back And I Miss The Backlight Design , But It Is A Value For Money Product . Works Flawlessly With Mac As Well As Windows.",Https://M.Media-Amazon.Com/Images/I/41Eivjvxxsl._Sx300_Sy300_Ql70_Fmwebp_.Jpg,Https://Www.Amazon.In/Logitech-920-007596-Multi-Device-Bluetooth-Keyboard/Dp/B0148Nph9I/Ref=Sr_1_426?Qid=1672903016&S=Computers&Sr=1-426

No Concerns Regarding The Time Taken Or The Print Quality. The Only Markdown For This Product Is The Setup. The User Manual Is Brief And Doesn'T Explain How To Setup The Printer Wirelessly Or By Usb. We Spent A Good Hour Having To Look Through The Online Manual And You Tube Videos To Understand How This Was Configured And Through Trial And Error, We Managed To Get It All Ready.,Easy To Install,Good Print And Enough For Home Usage But Installation Is Quite Tedious.,Budget Product.

It'S Easy To Use. Print Quality Is Also Good. Scanning Is Easy And It'S Image Is Fine. Canon Product Quality Is Good To Say.,Shipment Received In Time On 25 Th Sept. Due To Lack Of Time I Could Test The Product Recently. It Is Working Fine. Wi Fi Set Up Could Not Perform Successfully, I Shall Try Again Shortly. Other Function Are Working Satisfactory. Only Worried Is That The Cost Of Its Ink Cartridges.,Printing Photo'S Ar Totally Not Clear,Pros:1) The Best / Only Wifi All In One Printer In The Range Of 5K With Ink Saver (So Called).2) Low Usage Required & Low Maintenance: Thought Of Buying Ink Tank But Learnt From Friends That It'S Suitable For Heavy Printing And When They Didn'T Use It For A While Repairs Needed. Hence Decided To Go For Inkjet With Low Cost Maintenance. This Doesn'T Require Daily Print Like Ink Tanks.3)  Product Is Solid Built And No Issues Observed So Far. Many Long Term Reviews Also Confirmed Flawless Working For Years So Decided This Model.4) Print Quality: Black Is Very Good But Colour Is Average. Does The Job For Kids School Project Purpose.5) Easy Setup : It'S Very Easy To Setup If You Are Techy. Setting Up Wifi Took Little Bit Of Time (An Hour). I Hate Reading Manuals And It Was First Time With A Printer At Home.6) Wi-Fi Printing Via Mobile Is A Breeze With Canon Selphy App. Easy Photo Editor By Canon Is Also Quite Useful /Handy.Cons:1) Black Is Good But Colour Is Pretty Average. Like I Said Good Enough For Home /Students Purpose.2) Not Happy With Cartidges Supplied By Canon. They Seem To Fill Only Half Or Less For Demo Purpose. It Gave Around 100 Pages For Black And 15-20 Pages Of Color With Lowest Quality Settings (Where In They Claim 250 Black And 100 Color). Both Cartidges Were Almost Empty And Mobile App Started Showing The Same.2) Ink Cartidges Cost & Yield: The Cost Cartridges Seems To Be Increasing (When I Was Purchasing This It Was Around 500 For Black But Now It'S Around 600) And I Had No Faith On The Yield Based On What I Have Got With Stock Cartidges. It'S Not Worth Buying Cartidges So Go For Refill.3) We Only Find Cl 57S Which Is Small. Where Is Cl 57 (Large Size) ?

New Update Details Given,Good Tablet","First I Would Like To Comment On The Tab Market Of India. The Most Peculiar Thing I Have Seen In India Is, When A Particular Product Is Aimed Towards Students Or Education Suddenly Corporations Go Out Of Their Way To Milk Money And Under Deliver As Much As Possible. It Is Exactly Opposite To How Students Are Given Access To Technology In The Usa. You Watch The Prices Of Chromebooks, Tablets, Back To School Offers In The Us And Compare Them To India And It Feels Extremely Unbalanced. After The Pandemic There Was A Huge Surge In The Tab Market And Tier 1 Brands Started Delivering Garbage For 20000 Rupees. Snapdragon 400, Old Mediatek, 4Gb Ram, Abysmal Non Ips Screen For 20K Just To Mint Money And Take Advantage Of Pandemic Scenario And The Circumstances Of Students. This Tablet Brings The Revolution.I Am No Student, But Bought This For Day To Day Use And I Am An User Of The Normal Big Bezel 7Th Gen Ipad, So My Review Will Be Comparative In Nature. Also I Bought This At 23000 Rupees So My Judgements Will Be In Accordance To The Price I Paid.1. If You Are Planning To Buy An Ipad, Just Buy It Considering 64Gb Is Enough For You And You Use It For Normie Scenarios. You Do Day To Day Stuff You Will Be Satisfied With Your Ipad With Its Everlasting Updates.This Tablet If Compared Spec Vs Spec Give A Good Challenge To The Ipad For 23K Rupees. Even For 27K It Is Fine.2. Build Is Fine Although I Put A Tempered Glass On The 1St Day Itself. Back Is Plastic But Sides Are Metal And The Back Gets Quite Smudgy.3. The Ips Screen Is Really Good, There Is No Backlight Bleeding, No Dead Pixels As You Can See In The Picture With The Dark Background. I Am Used To Oled Screens On Phones So At First Blacks May Disappoint But Oled Is Impossible At This Price. The Screen Is Better Than My 7Th Gen Ipad'S Display. It Is Brighter, Has More Punchy Colours, Blacks Are Darker. On Top Of That 120Hz Panel, Hdr Certification, Dolby Vision Support Makes It Great For Content Consumption. It Would Be A Great Device For Xbox Cloud Gaming With The Xbox Controller Attached To It. Display Is The Part Of The Device With Which You Interact The Most And Display Is The Highest Point Of This Tablet.4. Snapdragon 860 Is Fine In A Market Where Older Mediateks And Lower Midrange Snapdragons Are Dumped Into The Market. Hence I Say If You Don'T Want This Just Buy An Ipad But Don'T Buy Any Other Android Tablet At 20-30K Price Point. All Are Trash. 860 Was Fine With All Those Games Which Rule The Market Today. It Has Less Pixels To Push Than In A Phone And The Bigger Surface Area Helps In Better Heat Dissipation So Gaming Is Effortless.5. I Can'T Comment On How The Battery Will Serve Me In The Long Run But For Now I Don'T See Any Drain Or Backup Issues With Content Consumption Or Gaming. It Has A 22.5 Watt Charger In The Box Although It Does Support 33 Watt Charging. The Bigger Battery Takes Some Time To Charge With The Inbox Charger But My Ipad Takes Even Longer With Its Trash Charger And It Has A Bigger Battery And Apple Devices Are Extremely Picky With Chargers.6. The Camera Is Okayish, Just Like Most Tablet Cameras. The Ipad Has Even Worse Cameras. For Document  Scanning It Should Be Fine But Other Than That It Is Not Much Useful. It Is Still Better Than What Samsung And Lenovo Gives In 25K Range Tablets.7. The Second Highest Point Of This Tablet Is Its Quad Speakers. They Are Loud, Have Depth, Are Not Sibilant And Have Brilliant Stereo Separation And Soundstage. They Are Louder And Punchier Than Those Normal Non Ultrabook Thiccc Laptops Which Cost 40-50K. They Will Hit You As A Massive Surprise. I Did Not At All Expect Such Good Speakers. They Seriously Outmatch Those Cheapo 700Rs Boat, Goat, Mivi Generic Speakers In Terms Of Distortion At Max Volumes, Separation And Low End. Of Course Those Cheap Speakers Would Be Louder And More Shrill But It Is About Quality Vs Quantity.Coming To The Cons-1. Was It Courage Or Something Else That Xiaomi Couldn'T Find A Place For A 3.5Mm Jack. Not Even A Dongle In The Box. They Should Seriously Stop Copying Apple'S Wrong Habits And Instead Copy Their Good Habits Like Long Device Support Via Updates. Although I Mitigated The Issue By Using Portable Dongle Dacs Like Shanling Ua1, Ibasso Dc03.....Etc Which I Generally Use With Even My Phones And My Pc Coz They Are Way Better Than On Board Audio Of Most Devices Except Some Devices Like Some Lg Phones With Quad Dac. I Am An Audio Enthusiast So I Spend Money On Such Products And You Need Not. Although It Works With My Old Mi A2 Dongle Just Fine.2. For 23000 Rupees I Don'T Expect The Pen And People Who Are Expecting A Pen With 23K Tablet Should Really Open Their Eyes And Look The Disaster Also Know As Indian Tablet Market And Its Offerings But For 27K They Could Just Offer A Bundle Where You Pay 1K-2K Rupees More And Get The Pen As An Add On.3. The Accessory Market Might Not Be That Vibrant. Already There Are No Unofficial Cases Available From Good Brands. There Is One From Nillkin Here On Amazon And The Seller Has The Audacity To Price It At 5000 Rupees Lol. The Official Xiaomi Folio Case Is Magnetic Slap On At The Back And I Don'T Trust Those Type Of Cases.One More Issue That I Would Like To Point Out Is That Xiaomi Lately Has A Tendency To Creep Up Prices By 500-1000 Rupees Within A Month Or Two By Doing The Good Old ""Gst Bro"". So If It Ever Reaches 28-29K For The 128Gb Version Just Close Your Eyes And Buy An Ipad With Card Discounts.So, In A Nut Shell For 23K It Is Was No Brainer, But Even For 27K It Is A Really Good Deal Considering What Its Competitors Are.Hope This Was Helpful.,I Have Been Using The Mi Pad 5 For Over A Month Now, And Am Only Glad That I Didn'T Spend More On An Ipad. Once The Retail-Therapy Phase Of The Device Wears Off, What Remains Is The User Experience. While It Is True For Both Devices, I Find That I'M More At Ease With The Mi Pad 5 For The Sheer Look And Feel Of The Content I Watch In It. I Also Spend A Lot Of Time Reading Books And Illustrated Designs (Pdfs) And I Often Found Myself Amazed (Almost Chuffed) Over How Good The Content Looked. That Display Gets The Accolades For A Reason.The Mi Pad 5 Largely Meets My Expectations And When People See This Tablet, The Immediate Comparison They Make Is How Much It Resembles The Ipad (A Gross Generalisation). So, Here'S My Take On Apple'S Ipad (9Th Gen) Vs. Xiaomi Pad 5If You Have An Apple Device Already, And Are Especially Looking To Expand On The Productivity Element From The Tablet, You Need To Stick To The Ipad. Not Just Because It Is Going To Regulate The Standard, But You Will Definitely Miss Out On The Features That Eco-System Offers.So, Buy The Ipad If You:Are Not Concerned About The Price-Tagare Looking At Designing With The Apple Pencil And Are Familiar With, Or Going To Use Procreateare Making An Investment With This Purchase And Will Not Be Back In The Market For A New Tablet Anytime Soon.Intend To Use The Tablet For Presentations And Want To Take No Chances With The Devicehave A Clear Purpose For The 'Sidecar' Feature - If You Don'T Use It Despite Buying The Ipad, You Are Missing Out!Engage In A Lot Of Official Video-Conferences And Are Prone To Moving About And May Accidentally Go Out Of Frame. The Ipad Has A Feature That Addresses This To An Extent.Are Not Expecting Substantially Higher Results Than The Mi Pad 5 From The In-Built Camera In General.Have A Proclivity Towards The Apple Design, Their Decisions And Are Generally Happy With The Software Choices Apple Makes For You.Don'T Really Care About Features Beyond A Rigid List Of Activities You Are Certain The Ipad Is Able To Do; And That This List Is Unlikely To Change In The Near Future.Looking For A Reliable Product That Will Receive Software Support For A Long Period Of Time.Are Expecting The Device To Be Used By Responsible Adults Who Are Careful With The Tabletare Unaffected By Hefty Repair Costs Should The Glass Crack Or The Rear Panel Be Dentedhave A Need To Use Touch Idon The Other Hand, Buy The Mi Pad 5 If You:Are Looking At Gaming On A Plethora Of Titles That Are On The Google Playstore And Perhaps Not Found Elsewheredon'T Care Much About The Stock Ios Cookie-Cutter Experience And Think Customization Is The Only Way You'Ll Truly Be Happy With The Tablet You Use.Want The Best Quality Of Video And Photo Capture From A Tablet - Meaning Better Video Calls And Video Capture. This Doesn'T Mean The Camera Will Replace The Phone You Already Have, But The Pad 5 Is A Tool That Goes The Extra-Mile Of Taking Good Quality Images, Scanning Documents And Allows Edits On Its Large Screen.Value Video-Quality From The Mi Pad Camera Than The Ai That Drives The Face-Tracking Function Ipad Offers.Want The Most Of The Audio Experience, Higher Audio Quality, Clarity And Richness.Are Expecting Rich Colour Depth, Hdr Quality Video Experience And Will Be Spending More Than 50% Of Your Time On The Tablet Watching Videos.Don'T Like Limitations Imposed On You, As With The Software You Use (Sideload Apks), Rooting, Custom Firmware, Overclocking, Etc. If You Do Any Or All Of These, Forget About The Ipad.Are Mostly Going To Use It As A Fun Device To Watch Movies On Or Consume Audio-Visual Mediaare Not Expecting To Pay An Arm And A Leg (Comparatively) To Fix A Broken Screen Or A Damaged Back Panel.Are Okay Without A Fingerprint Scanner And Is Okay With Faceid, Pin Or Pattern For Security.At The End Of The Day, You As A User Of The Tablet Spend Most Of Your Time Looking At The Glorious Screen Of The Tablet And Interacting With What Inside The Device; Not The Logo At The Back.,The Tablet Is Totally Fine But Sometimes Is Bucked Out There Is So Many Bugs Bugs Glitches I Have Contact To Xiaomi  They Will Try To Fix It. One Req Don'T Upgraded After You Buy Don'T Have To Do 13.0.6 . After The Update Not A Single Google Application Is Running On Floating Window And While Split Screen There Is So Many Black Patches Around The Bar White Bar Sometimes. Nice Tablet You Can Go With It. And If You Are Thinking About Productivity Multimedia Go For It Because Most Mostly As Student Do Presentation Word Excel Taken Notes And All The Things And Handle Easily Were By This Tablet And I Am Using It For Games And Other Purposes It Handle It Quite Nicely But You Have To Wait For Android L Because Android 12L Is Good For Tablet.New Update Is Here.So The New Android 12 Update Is Here Unfortunately Is Not Android 12 L But Is Working Fine All The Bugs Has Been Fixed Few Miner Bugs Are There But It'S Totally Refined From The Past And System Is Working Great 120 Hertzs Now Looks Amazing Because Animation Bugs Has Been Fixed And Battery Life Is Been Fixed Is Now Working More Than 10 Hours Fortunately Video Playback And For Day To Day Task You Can Go Easily 2 To 3 Days Because I Am Doing Ppt Excel Sheet And Other Documentation It'S Work Totally Fine And Yeah That'S The New Update And Go For Xiaomi Back 5. About Pencilso I Bought Xiaomi Pencil For 6000 And If I Say Latency Has Been Improved But If If You Don'T Have The Budget Of 6000 Go For Another Shopping Site Which Name After F Cart YeahüôÇ And You Can Buy It'S F(Smart Buy) Pencil For 1500 Rupees It Works Fine Too And You Don'T Have To Spend 6000 You Can Go With The 1500 Just You Will Not Have Those Key Features Like Taking Screenshots And Write Something On It Or Double Tap To Note Down..,Over All I Am Satisfied With This Tablet,",Https://M.Media-Amazon.Com/Images/I/31Jukdjdjhl._Sx300_Sy300_Ql70_Fmwebp_.Jpg,Https://Www.Amazon.In/Snapdragon-Resolution-Refresh-27-81Cm-Display/Dp/B09Xxzxqc1/Ref=Sr_1_437?Qid=1672903017&S=Computers&Sr=1-437

Sony Mdr-Xb50Ap In Ear Extra Bass Earphones  Just For An Introduction I Would Like To Mention, I Am A Dire Fan For Flagship Electronic Goods & Manages To Fulfill My Passion For The ""Taste Of Quality"" From Time To Time. Now Let‚ÄôS Begin.. When You Start Looking For Earphones Or Headphones, Sennheiser Is Definitely A Brand Worth To Look For And Rightly So, The Brand Has Acquired A Great Reputation Of Producing Some Top Notch Quality Gears In Its Segment .I Too ,Started My Quest To Purchase Some Of The Best Sounding Earphones Within Reasonable Limits Of Purchasing Power & Excluding Those Insanely Pricey Ones.Read Some Very Good Reviews Of The Sennheiser Hd 202 Ii Professional Over-Ear Headphone From My Fellow Amazonians And Bought It.Found It To Be Reasonably Good But Having Certain Drawbacks( May Refer My Review Of Hd202 At Amazon) Which Were Not Upto My Taste.Next ,Unsettled , I Went To Purchase These Sennheiiser Cx 275 S In Earphones And Here Are My Observations:Design  & Construction :√ó√ó√ó√ó√ó√ó√ó√ó√ó√ó√ó√ó√ó√ó√ó√ó√ó√ó√ó√ó√ó√ó√ó√ó√óA.) Looks & Feels Delicate To Hold With Its Extremely Thin Wires And If You Are Casual In Handling Frequently, Then In The Long Run,Its Sure To Fail.B.) Wires Which Are Around 1.2 M In Expanse Are Not Tangle Free And Keep Getting Into Random Knots Each Time You Get To Use It.C.) Comes With 3 Different Sized Earpieces To Snug Fit Different Ear-Anatomies And Provides Decent Sound Isolation But Not The Best.D.) Inconvincing Design Of The Earpiece Globes As The Bottom Tail Piece Below The Earpiece Was Not Large Enough To Grip With Fingers To Comfortably Fit Or Adjust The Earpieces In The Ears And Each Time You Had To Twist The Spherical Globes To Snug Fit.E.) Comes With A Gold Plated L-Shaped Additional Adapter For Better Fitment To Laptops Etcf.) Comes With A Small Pouch , Which For The Most Part Was A Useless Accessory For Me. A Case Or Box Would Have Been More A More Elegant Option. Squeezing The Whole Earphone Into The Li'Ll Pouch Everytime..Naah !! Feels Primitive..! But Then Its My Own Two Pieces.Sound Quality & Performance:Xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxthe Sound Quality Is Crisp & Clear , With Clear Mids And Crisp Pitches, Bass Was Okayish But Leaves You Craving For More Every Time You Plug It-In To Watch Some Movie Or Natgeo Documentaries.The Lack Of An Adequate Bass May Even Get Unsettling Sometimes.The Frequency Response As Per Specs Was 17 To 23000 Hz Against 4 To 24000 Hz Of Sony Mdr-Xb50Ap.Just To Quote Sony‚ÄôS Bass Could Get Really Deep & Low With Its 12Mm Drivers And Neodymium Magnets. For Purists Senneheiser Does Its Job Quite Honestly But In General As For Sony ‚ÄúA Little Make-Up Won‚ÄôT Hurt ‚Äù  Lol.Sound Quality Is Maintained Till The Maximum Volume Though It Felt Slightly That The Mids Succumbed To Pitches At The Apex.Verdict :Xxxxxxxxxxxxxx* Lack Of A Decent Bass & Extremely Fragile Design Is Unacceptable At A Price Range Of 1600 Bucks *For Me ""Not Worth It"".Details & Comparison :Xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxi Happened To Test The Quality & Performance Of All The 3 Renowned Sennheiser Hd 202 Ii Over The Ear Headphone, Sennheiser Cx 275 S In Earphone & Lastly Sony Mdr-Xb50Ap In Ear Extra Bass Earphones.Bass :Xxxxxxxxxxxxxxsony>>Senn.Hd 202 > Senn.Cx 275S ,The Extra Bass At Sony May Feel Out Of Place At Rare Instances But Never Feels Cheap, Redundant Or Unpleasant To The Ears. It‚ÄôS A Quality Refined Timbre  Bass & Not Some Low Quality Stuff. Hd 202 Bass Was Ok But Then It Had Other Issues With Sound Leaking From The Pads And Disturbing Others.Sound Quality :Xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxexcellent On All 3 But Sony A Bit Appealing With Its  Phenomenal Immersive Bass.Build & Design :Xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx Again Sony>>Senn.Hd 202 > Senn.Cx 275S .Sony‚ÄôS Wire Were Tangle Free, Earphone Pieces Felt Indestructible, Noise Isolation Was ‚ÄúUltimate‚Äù.Next Was Senn.Hd 202 And Least By Any Standards Was Senn.Cx 275S.The Fragile Design Of The Wires Around Mic. In Senn.Cx 275 May Itself Be A Let Alone Discarding Feature For Many.1.) Senn.Hd 202 Ii Might Be Good For Gamers And Watching From A Distance With Its Long Cord If Leaking Sound To Outside World Is Not An Issue.Bass Is Anytime Better Than Senn.Cx 275 S But Not As Mesmerising As Sony.Sound Quality Though Is Very Good,Crisp And Clear.2.) Senn.Cx 275 S Might Be Good For Purists But Even With Its Balanced Highs And Mids..Serious Lack Of Bass Keeps You Longing For More ..Especially If You Are More Into Movies,Games And Documentaries Than Music.Moreover Its Extremely Fragile & Always Tangling Thin Wires  Is A Constant Annoying Feature.3.) Sony Mdr Xb50Ap Gets The Most Evident And Refined High Quality Deep Bass With Crisp High And Quality Mids.Its Indestructible Unique Design Offers The Best Noise Isolation Of All And Comes With The Most Sturdy Tangle Free Wires.**Do Not Consider Higher Bass As An Adulteration To Pure Music.Its A Quality Bass With Frequency Response As Low As 4 To 24000 Hz.Adds A Mesmerizing Essence To The Quality Of Sound Which Is Absent On Other Two.Probably Like A Super Amoled With Extra Vivid Colors That Look More Punchy & Full Of Life.Anyways At The End Of The Day Its Your Call.Keep Listening.,Note:@ There Are Thousands Of Reviews For This Product, But Surprisingly There'S Hardly Any Review Explaining Its Performance In Long Run And Comparing This Earphones With Similar Ones Available In Market.@ I Am Using These Earphones Since Last One Year And In The Meantime I Also Happen To Use Jbl C100Si And Sennhesiers Cx180, So I Would Be Comparing All These 3 Earphones In This Review.@ You Get A "" L "" Shaped Connector In These Earphones, So Note That.I Am Dividing This Review In Several Subtopics Directly Stating My User Experience And Stating Which Is The Best Earphone In That Subtopic,Built Quality :------------------‚óè Boat - Flat Cables Which Is Tangle Free In True Sense. Metal Housing Holds Up Good, But Colour Sheds Off After 5-6 Months. Perfect ""L"" Shaped Connector Which Is Apt For Using With Laptops While Resting.‚óè Jbl - Small Round Cables, Shredding Off After 7-8 Months Of Moderate Usage. Plastic Housing Doing Great So Far.Connector Is Bent, But Not In Perfect ""L"" Shape, So Its Quite Pain To Use While Resting.‚óè Sennheiser - Small Round Cables, Holding Up Good After 1 Year Of Rough Use. Plastic Housing Has Become Slick, As Rubber Coating On It Has Shredded Off. Perfect ""L"" Shaped Connector Which Is Apt For Using With Laptops While Resting.‚óè‚óè Winner- Boat 225 ‚óè‚óèComfort :------------‚óè Boat - Comfortable Enough When Used While In Upright Position. These Are Very Uncomfortable When You Use Them While Resting On Couch Or Bed For Watching Movies Or So. Has Very Long Earphone Head.‚óè Jbl - Comfortable Enough In Upright Position. Slightly Uncomfortable Using While Resting, As These Have Offset Opening.‚óè Sennheisers - Comfortable In Both The Position. These Are Apt For Long Duration Usage.‚óè‚óè Winner - Sennheisers Cx180 ‚óè‚óèLoudness :-------------Cx180 > Boat 225 > Jbl Cs100Si‚óè Boat - Tends To Distort Above 75% Level Of Volume.‚óè Jbl - Crystal Clear Even At Full Volume, But Has Least Sound Level In All Of Three.‚óè Sennheisers - Tends To Distort Above 75% Level Of Volume, But Has Greater Sound Level Of All.‚óè‚óè Winner - Sennheisers Cx180 ‚óè‚óèSound Quality ( Bass, Mids & Lows ) :---------------------------------------------I Noticed That All Of Them Have Almost Same Mids & Lows, Which Are Strong & Crisp. But Bass Levels Are Different.‚óè Boat - Has Average Bass, I Am Very Disappointed With It, Since These Earphones Are Marketed As Bassheads.‚óè Jbl - Has Least Bass Of All, I Felt Treble Is High In These.‚óè Sennheisers - Ton Of Bass And When Used Proper Eartips, Its Just A Treat For Bass Lovers.‚óè‚óè Winner - Sennheisers Cx180 ‚óè‚óèSound Quality Over Call :----------------------------------‚óè Boat - I Noticed In Early Few Months, Quality Over Call Was Great, But Started To Deplete After 5-6 Months. But Its Still Good, Not As Good As New. Noise Cancellation Is Good And Noticeable By Person On Other Side.‚óè Jbl - Its Quite Average And Has Maintained The Quality Over A Year Now.‚óè Sennheisers - Their No Microphone, Lol :Pnote: Boat & Jbl Both'S Mics Works With Android And Ios Perfectly.‚óè‚óè Winner - Boat 225 ‚óè‚óèCustomer Care :--------------------‚óè Boat : 1 Year Warranty. Had No Issues Till Date, So Didn'T Got Chance To Check It. But Some Of My Friends Who Ran Into Issue Had Mixed Experiences.‚óè Jbl : 1 Year Warranty. Had Issue With One Ear Piece And Was Replaced Within 2 Weeks After Contacting Nearest Service Center.‚óè Sennheisers : 2 Years Warranty. I Had 2 Of These And One Pair Stopped Working After A Year And Half, Was Replaced Immediately Within A Week After Contacting Nearest Service Center.Note: I First Contacted The Company Via Mail With My Product Details And I Was Given All The Required Details For Service. I Would Suggest This To All.‚óè‚óè Winner : Sennheiser Cx180 ‚óè‚óèConnectivity :------------------All The Earphones Have 3.5Mm Connector And Works Perfectly With Both Android And Ios Devices.Verdict :----------I Don'T Think I Need To Explain Anything Else Now, Since I Mentioned All The Points Of All These Earphones. To Sum Up, I Would Say Boat 225 Are Good, If You Are Going To Use The Mic Alot And Not Going To Use These Earphones While Resting On Couch For Watching Movies. If You Want Mic And Even Want To Watch Movies Resting, Then Go For Jbl Cs100Si. But If You Want The Earphones Only For Watching The Movies And Listening To Songs Like Me, Then Certainly Go For Sennheisers Cx180.Hope This Review Helps You Make Sound Decision.",Https://M.Media-Amazon.Com/Images/W/Webp_402378-T2/Images/I/31Vnhityb+L._Sy300_Sx300_.Jpg,Https://Www.Amazon.In/Sennheiser-Cx-80S-Ear-Earphone/Dp/B083T5G5Pm/Ref=Sr_1_438?Qid=1672903017&S=Computers&Sr=1-438

For Me Personally I Tested Out At Multiple Occassion Using It For A Month Or Two I Never Got Speed Above 38 Watt And I Tested It With The Cable That I Received From The Box And It Also Gave Me The Same Speed So Buy Carefully If You'Re Conditions Are Good And You Get Speed More Tha 50Watss Then Only You Should Buy It Or You Should Go With 3A/4A Cables As They Are Cheaper And More Durable Braided Cables,The Cable Supports Fast Charging (I'M Using A Oneplus 65W Charger) As Advertised.

In My Experience, Braided Cables Are Easy To Wrap And Store When Not In Use And They Dont Get Frayed Easily.
